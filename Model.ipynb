       "      <td>Boris Johnson was crowned Conservative leader by MPs who knew he was lazy, unprincipled, and incompetent, a charlatan driven by one cause: himself. But there was a greater consideration than his suitability for high office, and that was his effectiveness as an antidote to the twin menaces of Faragism and Corbynism. If they did not recoup their electoral losses to the Brexit party, and disillusioned remainers flocked back to the Labour fold, Toryism faced an existential crisis that might parachute Jeremy Corbyn into No 10. Johnson was the panic button, to be pressed only in the direst of political emergencies. Uniquely, of any viable Tory candidate, Johnson met the challenge of the age of populism, and his Teflon qualities allowed him to revise Brexit red lines – throwing his unionist allies into the Irish Sea – to secure a deal that his supporters could make-believe would cause Brussels to cave. The Tories are the world’s most successful electoral force in large part because their ruthlessness vastly exceeds their sentimentality. Margaret Thatcher led her party to three successive, thumping wins, overturned Britain’s postwar social democratic order, smashed the trade unions and forced her opponents to capitulate to key tenets of her philosophy. Thank you very much, said her parliamentary party three years after her 1987 landslide victory, but now you must go because you have outlived your usefulness and become a menace to our prospects. Some wept as they betrayed her, and the price was a fratricidal Tory split that lasted for a generation; but it was a tolerable price for routing Neil Kinnock’s Labour party. Unlike Johnson, Thatcher was respected, admired and indeed loved by her party. The sole observable skill of our present incumbent is that he is an eccentric and successful campaigner. Which brings us to the danger of the present moment, in which Boris Johnson absorbs the blame for a national catastrophe for which his party is collectively responsible. After Theresa May – whose MPs once called her “Mummy” when she appeared master of all before her – self-detonated with the 2017 snap election, George Osborne described her as a “dead woman walking”. Yet her MPs preserved her zombie premiership for another two years, because she retained a vital role: let the coming inferno incinerate her career, then start afresh. Today’s Conservative parliamentarians are aware that Johnson is a byword for shambolic; and while the Brexit culture wars currently appear to offer a firewall – their electoral floor remains a stubborn 40% – the worst death toll and recession in Europe are eroding Johnson’s charismatic selling point, his can-do optimism. Keir Starmer’s Labour party has made competence their signature dividing line between them and the Tory administration. It’s a strategy that has historical precedent. Back in 1992, Labour collected rich political dividends after Britain crashed out of the European exchange rate mechanism despite having supported the country’s entry. Why not again offer no distinctive alternatives to the Tory pandemic response, pin the disaster on Johnson’s incompetence and win by default? The danger lies in underestimating Tory ruthlessness. The Johnson reboot targeted two key Tory weaknesses – the loss of its leave flank, and disillusionment with a decade of austerity – by promising a harder Brexit and targeted spending announcements in three distinctively popular areas: the NHS, schools and police. If Johnson is an obvious long-term liability – and if he has truly tired of the position he spent a lifetime craving, as the rightwing press speculate – then, like his predecessor, he will be surely kept in place until the worst is over and then disposed of. Should his reputation for competent economic management survive the next six months of restrictions, Rishi Sunak would be a natural candidate to replace Johnson. If he is savvy, he will replicate his predecessor’s trick of pretending to head an entirely new government that breaks definitively with the past, remorselessly jettisoning those most associated with the pandemic – so long Matt Hancock, and thanks for all the car-crash interviews! The first person of colour as prime minister would offer a convincing story of change. Faced with a new government, Labour would be forced to pivot from their current strategy. But there is another more compelling and honest dividing line. Britain was plunged into the abyss not by incompetence but by ideology. Lockdown was fatally delayed in a misguided attempt to protect business interests, ensuring both a deadlier outbreak and a greater economic hit, as consumer confidence dropped. The disastrously premature drive to force people back to the office – “or risk losing your job”, as the Telegraph put it exactly four weeks ago – put the interests of corporate property owners ahead of public health and again the economy. There was a lack of personal protective equipment because years of cuts meant stockpiles had diminished. Outsourcing led to a collapsed trace-and-test system, a disaster that should be attributed not to incompetence but to valuing private profit over the building of public infrastructure. As coronavirus restrictions are reimposed, Sunak’s soon to be withdrawn support measures – potential U-turns notwithstanding – will sacrifice livelihoods on the altar of Tory anti-state ideology. While incompetence can be pinned on to one disposable man, ideology is harder to scrub away. If unemployment increases and we see a Rishi Sunak recession, responsibility should be rooted in the very political nature of the Conservative party, not the maladroitness of one particular administration. Labour should fear the two “Rs” that have long preserved Tory hegemony – ruthlessness and reinvention. Starmer is competence incarnate; but, when Johnson is shuffled off without remorse, that may not be enough. • Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</td>\n",

       "      <td>Lawmakers in Idaho are pushing to drastically reduce wolf numbers in the state, perhaps by as much as over 90%, complementing other US efforts to shrink their population. Idaho’s gray wolf population was recently estimated at 1,556, but sponsors of a bill approved in the state senate last week say that the preferred number of wolf packs in the state is 15. Because a wolf pack in the region averages 10 wolves, this means the bill could lead to hunters killing well over 1,000 wolves.\\nThe bill will see a vote in the state house of representatives today, where Republicans, who generally support the measure, hold a 58-12 majority. If successful, the bill will land on the desk of the governor for his signature soon after. Recent months have seen a dramatic reversal of fortunes for US gray wolves. Since the Trump administration removed Endangered Species Act protections from gray wolves on 4 January, interest groups and states moved quickly to weaken protections and open up hunting of the wild canine. Conservation groups quickly sued the federal government to relist the species. Until that lawsuit is resolved, or the Biden administration intervenes, management of wolves is up to the states. Wisconsin, which has a law requiring the state to hold a wolf hunt,conducted one soon after, resulting in hunters killing at least 216 wolves in less than 60 hours. A researcher estimated that an additional 115 wolves were poached, or illegally killed. The state’s hand was in part forced by Hunter Nation, a hunting organization founded by prominent Trump supporter Don Peay, which filed a lawsuit to force the state wildlife agency to hold the hunt. The Montana governor, Greg Gianforte, who was cited for breaking state hunting regulations in killing a wolf, recently signed a bill into law that would allow the state to reimburse wolf hunters and trappers for their expenses. In South Dakota, wolves were classified as predatory animals following de-listing, and can now be hunted and trapped, as the state leadership does not wish for the animals to establish themselves in the state. If passed, the Idaho bill would allow each hunter to use any methods available for killing other wild canines in the state, such as coyotes, which include the use of bait, spotlights at night, as well as electronic calls. It would also allow hunters to kill an unlimited number of wolves each year, increase the funding for the state’s Wolf Depredation Board to hire private contractors to shoot and trap wolves, and allow wolves to be snared and trapped on private land all year long. The Idaho fish and game commission, which is mandated to manage fish and wildlife in the state, opposed the legislation. Prior to near decimation via European colonization, wolves populated much of North America. The gray wolf, which the US Fish and Wildlife Service called “an integral component of the ecosystems to which it typically belongs”, was slowly recovered via conservation efforts, but has remained at the center of controversy ever since. Often perceived to be a threat to the hunting and livestock industries, the gray wolf has also been shown to make more resilient elk herds. Garrick Dutcher, research and program director for Living With Wolves, told the Guardian the Idaho bill is dangerous because “should the legislature set this precedent, they could wrestle away authority from the fish and game commission for other species as well”. He points out that the department of fish and game is staffed with biologists, while the state legislature is not. Dutcher contends that of the 2.5 million cattle in Idaho, fewer than 200 are lost each year to wolves. The number in 2020 was 84. “Every year, we lose far more to coyotes, to bad weather, to birth complications, and disease – orders of magnitude more,” he said. But Cameron Mulrony, executive vice-president of the Idaho Cattle Association, said the livestock and big game industries experience economic losses as a result of wolves. “A cow taken by a wolf is similar to a thief stealing an item from a production line in a factory,” he said. “The loss of a portion of a production line must be replaced, costing dollars. In addition the down time and loss of production while that replacement is put into place, and added to the line is an additional cost. Lastly, stress put on portions of any production line also create costs to the business.” Citing the rash of efforts to remove protections for wolves and hunt them, Amaroq Weiss, senior west coast wolf advocate for the Center for Biological Diversity, said that “all of the same political forces that have been at this for years have never gone away. Their effort is to undo whatever progress has been made, and if they could, eradicate wolves all over again.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>'An indictment of South Africa': whites-only town Orania is booming</td>\n",
       "      <td>October in Orania can be charming. When the sun sets, long ribbons of burnt orange settle on the horizon. The flies and mosquitoes that come with the oppressive summer heat haven’t arrived yet. It is Magdalene Kleynhans’ favourite time of year. “You can sit outside until late into the night,” says the businesswoman, whose family spend much of their time outdoors. Her children fish from the banks of the Orange River whenever they choose. Kleynhans leaves the house unlocked. “It’s a good life. It’s a big privilege.” But there is much more to this small Northern Cape town than the bucolic ideal painted by Kleynhans. Incredibly, 25 years after the fall of apartheid, Orania is a place for white people only.\\nKleynhans runs one of Orania’s biggest enterprises: a call centre whose business is recruiting and retaining members for Solidariteit, a trade union primarily for Afrikaner workers, and Afriforum, a self-styled “civil rights” movement. Afriforum recently met with US president Donald Trump’s administration and Tucker Carlson of Fox Nows to tell them that Afrikaners are facing a widely discredited genocide. Both have made extensive investments in Orania’s construction boom. Oranians claim the town is a cultural project, not a racial one. Only Afrikaners are allowed to live and work there to preserve Afrikaner culture, the argument goes.\\nMagdalene Kleynhans owns a call centre that employs around 55 people in Orania The reality, however, is a disquieting and entirely white town, littered with old apartheid flags and monuments to the architects of segregation. While there are no rules preventing black people from visiting, those who live nearby fear they would be met with violence.\\nThe town has faced numerous calls for it to be broken up over the years, with prominent author and advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi arguing its existence violates South Africa’s successful dismantling of racial segregation. “Orania,” he says, “represents downright hostility to the idea of a single, united, non-racial country.” Large-scale eviction Orania was created in 1991, a year after Nelson Mandela’s release from Robben Island, and three years before the country’s first democratic election. Set among lush pecan nut orchards in the otherwise arid Karoo, it was set-up as an Afrikaner-only hamlet, not dissimilar from the ethnic Bantustans established under former prime minister, Hendrik Verwoerd, often dubbed the “architect of apartheid”.\\nBusts of former presidents of the town surround the statue of town mascot De Kleine Reus (The Little Giant), a young boy rolling up his sleeves, intended to symbolise the Oranians’ belief in self reliance\\nBy the end of the 1980s, the probability of losing control had already occurred to many Afrikaners, with some believing that impending democracy posed an existential threat to the white Afrikaans way of life. A few felt protecting that required becoming a demographic majority somewhere, rather than remaining a minority everywhere. So a small group of Afrikaners – Verwoerd’s daughter and son-in-law, Carel Boshoff, among them – purchased a strip of land on the southern banks of the Orange River, and went about setting up a volkstaat, or independent homeland, where Afrikaners would decide their own affairs.\\nOrania’s founders did not settle on virgin territory, but on the remains of a half-realised 1960s project to build canals and dams along the Orange River. A community of 500 poor black and mixed-race squatters who had made their homes in the buildings left behind by the project stood between the new owners and their whites-only vision.\\nBlack people are restricted to using the petrol station on the edge of Orania Speaking to the community after the purchase, Boshoff reportedly said he “did not buy a bus with passengers”. What followed, according to Cambridge historian Edward Cavanagh’s history of land rights on the Orange River, was one of the last large-scale evictions under apartheid. It was carried out by the future residents of Orania, with the assistance of beatings, pistol whippings and dogs. The population has doubled After three decades as a quiet backwater, Orania is booming. Its population – currently around 1,700 – has doubled over the last seven years. The most recent census estimates growth of more than 10% a year, outstripping most comparable rural towns and more, proportionally, than South Africa’s biggest cities. Population growth means a flourishing housing market and construction industry. Neat suburban homes have been joined by new apartment blocks and walkups which sell for as much as R1.5 million (£80,000), putting them on par with comparable homes in Johannesburg. There is an industrial zone of brick and aluminium factories which sell their products around South Africa. China buys most of the pecan nuts.\\nThe growth shows no signs of slowing. A sewage works meant to accommodate 10,000 future residents is in the pipeline. There are designs to transform the town’s humble technical training facility – where many of the skills driving the town’s new construction were taught – into a university. Not a single brick has been laid by a black worker. In a reverse of the usual situation in South Africa, all low-paying work in Orania – from keeping the town’s gardens to packing the shelves in its grocery stores – is performed by hard-up white Afrikaners. It is increasing numbers of poor labourers, whose tenancy is often less secure and who either rent or rely on subsidies from Orania’s cooperative bank, who are largely behind the town’s growing population.\\nAll low-paying work in Orania is performed by hard-up white Afrikaners. The town also has its own currency, the ‘Ora’. Orania is owned by the Vluytjeskraal Aandeleblok (Vluytjeskraal Share Block) company which, together with a series of internally elected bodies, is responsible for the town’s municipal decision making. People who want to live in Orania buy shares in the Vluytjeskraal Aandeleblok, instead of freehold. The screening of prospective shareholders allows for tight control. Buyers undergo extensive vetting, central to which is their fidelity to Afrikaans language and culture, a commitment to employing only white Afrikaners, and a string of conservative Christian undertakings. Unmarried couples, for instance, cannot live together. The town exists at the mercy of the South African constitution. In the early 2000s, a planned remapping of boundaries that would have brought Orania under the control of a democratically elected municipality appeared to spell the end, but the town successfully appealed to the high court using the constitutional rights of the country’s minority cultural groups. Pursued and harassed A quarter of a century after the end of apartheid, black people are restricted to using the filling station on the edge of Orania. Benjamin Khumalo* is one of them. The 55-year-old and his wife, who have lived on a small nearby plot since the 1980s, were once pursued and harassed by a pickup truck covered with Orania stickers when walking home after an evening with friends. “Now you must run,” he urged his wife, pushing her through a fence. “I’ll be behind you.”\\nKhumalo still remembers when Orania was a home for black families. The guns carried on the hips of many Oranians, however, have been enough to convince him never to enter the town again. “They will hurt you,” he says. “There is nothing we can do.” Unsurprisingly, Orania’s white residents have a different take. The town’s doctor, Philip Nothnagel, describes South African cities as “warzones”. He lived in the country’s administrative capital, Pretoria, before he moved to Orania. The 10 months since have been the best of his life, he says. “It’s the first time in history that a country has been established without a war,” he adds, sporting a Lincolnesque beard after he dressed up as Paul Kruger during recent celebrations of the Boer hero. “It’s like boere [white Afrikaners] Disneyland. Except you never have to go home.”\\nNoticeboards at a local restaurant carry a warning to European journalists. The spectre of Verwoerd, the architect of apartheid, is difficult to escape. His portrait and bust seem to be around every corner. His wife, Betsie, is buried in the town, and her old home has been converted into a Verwoerd museum. His grandson Carel Boshoff junior is a former leader of the Orania Movement, which first proposed the idea of Orania in the 1980s. Boshoff junior is perhaps one of the more unlikely fans of the pianist Abdullah Ibrahim, whose music plays on a laptop in his office. Like his parents and grandparents, Boshoff fears white Afrikaners face a real threat of “being wiped out”, either through violence or what he calls “amalgamation”. He believes the recent expansion of Orania is just the start.\\nVerwoerd’s grandson, Carel Boshoff junior, worries white Afrikaners could be ‘wiped out’ “We are something like the phoenix in the ashes,” he says. “The questions to which Orania is the answer are so fundamental to the structure of South African society that you can’t express and affirm your Afrikaner identity without coming to the conclusion of a bigger Orania.” Offended by Orania Orania has continued largely uncontested since its victorious appeal to the high court in the early 2000s. The ANC government does not appear to be considering an appeal of the high court decision. Zamani Saul, head of the ANC-run Northern Cape government, has said an inquiry into Orania’s legal status is yet to be concluded. For Ngcukaitobi, the author, Orania “represents the reversal of the constitutional project of national building.” The rights that underpinned the town’s high court challenge against the remapping are not unlimited, he says. Anyone who cares about South Africa “would rightly be offended by what Orania represents, which is an enduring legacy of racial mobilisation”.\\nOrapeleng Moraladi, Northern Cape secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, blames the town’s continued existence on the courts, an uncooperative Orania leadership, and a lack of political will from the ANC. “[The town] is like embracing an apartheid system within a democratic state,” he says. “Orania is an indictment of the government of South Africa.” *Indicated names have been changed Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter.

       "      <td>Benedict Cumberbatch will play the Soviet spy Alexander Litvinenko in Londongrad, an HBO limited series, Variety reported on Thursday. Based on the book The Terminal Spy by Alan Cowell, Londongrad will feature the Sherlock Holmes actor as Litvinenko, the former KGB agent turned defector who was fatally poisoned by the radioactive isotope polonium-210 in 2006.\\nCumberbatch, an early favorite for a best actor Oscar nomination for his role in Jane Campion’s western drama Power of the Dog, will also executive-produce the series under his SunnyMarch production banner. Londongrad is not the only TV project in the works about Litvinenko, who fell ill after meeting two Russian agents at London’s Millennium hotel and slowly died from the poison over the course of three weeks. David Tennant is set to play the former spy in a four-part ITV series that will cover the poisoning and his widow Marina’s campaign to persuade the British government to name her husband’s killers and acknowledge Russia’s responsibility. (In September 2021, the European court of human rights found Russia responsible for his death.) Litvinenko, who worked in Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) as an organized crime officer, fled to London in 2000, where he became a writer, journalist and outspoken critic of Vladimir Putin. From 2003 until his death, he was also a counter-intelligence officer, advising MI6 as an expert on Russian organized crime. As he lay dying in London’s University College hospital, Litvinenko worked with Scotland Yard detectives to solve his own murder, tracing the fatal cup of tea back to a former comrade in the Russian secret service. The ITV program, written by George Kay and executive-produced by Patrick Spence, does not have a release date yet. Neither does Londongrad, which will be written by David Scarpa, who was most recently a writer, executive producer and co-showrunner on the Amazon series The Man in the High Castle. Apart from starring in Londongrad, Cumberbatch will reappear as Doctor Strange in the Marvel movies Spiderman: Far From Home in December and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, set for 2022.</td>\n",

       "      <td>‘Pick the shelves clean’: food shortage rap helps cut through gloom of Shanghai lockdown</td>\n",
       "      <td>A rap about food shortages has become a hit in Shanghai, with the artists behind the song describing it as an attempt to “cheer up” tens of millions of residents locked down in China’s largest city amid a surging Covid outbreak and increasing restrictions. The song, Grocery Shopping, laments empty shelves and fights in the supermarket aisles, and is set to footage of residents crowding around market stalls, or lining up for PCR tests. “Set your alarm, wake up, food fight,” the lyrics say. “Order that tofu, but the sauce all gone.” The song’s release comes as Shanghai authorities expanded some lockdown measures and the city reported record daily case numbers in an outbreak city-wide frustrations. China is in the midst of its worst outbreak of the pandemic, driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant. Shanghai is recording the bulk of cases, with the city’s outbreak yet to peak. It reported 5,656 asymptomatic cases and 326 symptomatic cases for Tuesday, up from 4,381 new asymptomatic cases and 96 new cases with symptoms for the prior day.\\nIn response the city has been divided in two, with four day lockdowns and mass testing drives beginning on Monday for one half, and Friday for the other. However late on Tuesday, authorities announced lockdown measures in some areas of the currently free section. The south-west district of Minhang announced public transportation would be suspended until 5 April, and residents in some western districts received notice from their housing committees that they would be stopped from leaving their compounds for the next seven days. “We express our deepest thanks to all residents! We will resume normal life soon, but in the next period of time we ask everyone to adhere closely to pandemic control measures, do not gather, and reduce movements,” said one notice seen by Reuters. Social media messages also circulated that areas of Puxi would be locked down from Wednesday, a claim dismissed by authorities as “rumour”. For weeks Shanghai authorities were vociferously rejecting rumours there were plans for lockdowns, arresting at least two people for spreading wrong information. Then on Sunday, plans sharply reversed with the announcement of split lockdowns for the city of 26 million people. Shanghai residents have expressed growing frustration with the measures imposed on the city, particularly food shortages in supermarkets. Residents have reported rising costs for fresh produce, with jokes in groupchats about the empty supermarket shelves soon forcing them to eat the community shrubbery. Elderly people have reported struggling with the technology required for online ordering. Amid the restrictions and shortages the rap, released on Monday by artists named CATI2, PJ, and Keyso, has become a hit in the city. The Shanghai lyricists sing about food fights, people waking up early to order food only to find ingredients sold out and delivery drivers all busy. In another section PJ describes escaping one lockdown to get trapped in another. “Thinking it was an excellent idea to use music to cheer up the people of Shanghai and dispel the negative atmosphere online, the three of us got started immediately,” PJ told Sixth Tone. “We chose buying vegetables as the theme, because it is the challenge that sums this outbreak up the most. I’ve been to the supermarket to stock up on food many times, and each time I saw people pick the shelves clean. It was even worse than when they buy up groceries before New Year.”\\nThere is growing discontent with China’s zero-Covid policies and the subsequent lockdowns across cities and provinces as Omicron challenges China’s usual methods of containing outbreaks. Coupled with the fear among officials of punishment for failures, harsh and hasty measures have in some cases proved distressing, even fatal. In a repeat of January’s lockdown in Xi’an, where at least one man died and a woman miscarried after they were denied entry to hospital, refusal of medical care is again causing concern in Shanghai. Media reports have described dialysis patients – who receive life-preserving treatment about three times a week – denied entry to multiple hospitals. Last week a nurse in Shanghai died after she was denied entry to hospitals after suffering an asthma attack. Such refusals go against government policy, which has only requested hospitals suspend general outpatient services. Additional research by Xiaoqian Zhu</td>\n",

       "      <td>‘I didn’t think this song would get as far as it did,” says Maren Morris of the single Rich, which is in the Top 10 of America’s country chart this week. “Because you’re a woman?” asks a fan, pressed up against the stage of this railway-arch venue. “Because I’m a woman,” Morris concurs. “And because we had to take ‘shit’ out.” The Nashville establishment may find sweary women a trial, yet Rich – a break-up song whose rap-minded lyric references Diddy and Benjamins – is a big hit, and Texas-born Morris one of country music’s most feted young singer-songwriters. Tonight’s acoustic one-off, hastily arranged simply because she fancied it, sold out in one minute. (A large-venue 2019 tour is penned in, along with the follow-up to debut album Hero.) The fuss stems from her gift for pairing storytelling (often told from the “ugly” point of view – “being the bad guy,” as she says of the swampy I Wish I Was) with walloping melodic hooks that cross genre lines to pop and R&amp;B. Even presented as bare-bones traceries, her songs, like her voice, are luminous and characterful; in the case of her inescapable, Zedd-produced EDM hit The Middle, the acoustic treatment replaces its polar chill with warmth. Tiny and personable, she calls her new husband Ryan Hurd on stage and tackles a potentially mushy duet with the observation: “This is straight-up country shit.” A tribute to the victims of the Route 91 Harvest festival shooting in 2017 – she had played the day before – is elegant: moving yet free of sentimentality. “This gig makes me miss being a songwriter with a guitar,” she says at the end, facing a future where such gigs will be a rarity.</td>\n",

The deal would be a loan until the summer and is being sold as offering the former Newcastle United right back an opportunity of forcing his way back into the France squad for Euro 2016.\\nThings have not worked out for Debuchy since his £12m transfer from St James Park to Arsenal 18 months ago. The 30-year-old lost his place after a spell spent injured on the sidelines and he now accepts he has little chance of displacing Héctor Bellerín. Accordingly Sunderland have attempted to hijack Rémi Garde’s plan to move for his compatriot by holding talks with Arsenal over a proposed loan fee for Debuchy, who last appeared in Arsène Wenger’s first team in November. “Whatever happens, even if it is to return [to Arsenal] this summer and then start again, I have to go this winter. I cannot stay at Arsenal,” Debuchy said earlier this month. “As the weeks go by, we get closer to the Euros. I have to play to try to return as soon as March for the Netherlands and Russia friendlies. I would have preferred to leave Arsenal last summer but the coach told me that I would have my chance. Ultimately, it was not the case.” It all represents quite a come down for a defender who made it clear he regarded Newcastle as a mere stepping stone to bigger and better things.

       "      <td>Hymn to Aphrodite ποικιλόθρον’ ἀθανάτ’ Ἀφρόδιτα Sappho, Fragment 1 I gather you were in the lobby Minutes before. Terrifying to almost see you again. I smelled the shockwave, the burning air. You were too sexual To be bourgeois, screams from the jungle On top of Mount Olympus. You were too violently beautiful. Last night I looked up at the sky, Lights out as I was falling asleep. There was the moon, a full moon, or nearly. It was you. I wasn’t, but I could have been, A god I was living in. I chose not to come out On stage and tell them what a poem is about. Pubic hair that befits a goddess. Pubic hair that equips a goddess. That little arrowhead of pubic hair that Magnifies your thighs’ magnificence. You look like a field of flowers. You look like flowers in a vase. You look like brains and breasts. You are life stabbing death to death. I’m packing heat. That’s a poem. My concealed Carry permit is revealed. I do what I do. Peaches goes it alone. I was like a god or I was like the tiny hermit crab Who walks around inside a borrowed empty shell Bigger than he is for protection. I carry the shell I’ve borrowed like an umbrella Wherever I go Along the shore. I dress up in one of my million-dollar suits. I scuttle along Broadway, Ready to be found out and eaten Naked. A thunderbolt from you Walks through my front door And knocks me to the floor Where you and I, in love, still are On top of Mount Olympus Screaming your eternal estrus, Eyes white and blank with blind Ecstatic lack of sight.\\nBilly Collins paid Frederick Seidel a fine tribute, quoted on the Poetry Foundation site: “He does what every exciting poet must do: avoid writing what everyone thinks of as poetry.” Somehow, though, Seidel’s work challenges even this nuanced compliment. The formalist in him is strong, and, while his writing avoids the poetic conventions currently dominant, it clearly declares itself to be poetry. The fresh, sometimes raw, diction, the rangy swagger and unpredictability, make Seidel thoroughly contemporary and urban, but his verse is a re-developer of traditional poetry rather than its iconoclast. Hymn to Aphrodite is a rebel classicist’s poem, a brew of the sacred and profane, delivered gulp by gulp. Seidel appreciates the essential erotic paradox: “screams from the jungle / On top of Mount Olympus”. This cocktail is a feast in the final stanza, the speaker and the woman he loves seeming to scream themselves into marble, their “Eyes white and blank with blind / Ecstatic lack of sight”. Love’s blind, as everyone knows, particularly to the beloved’s faults. Seidel gives the blindness a transforming emphasis and amplification. The ecstasy of love is contingent, in fact, on the lover’s lack of sight. It’s a note of realism rather than sourness. The rekindling of love produced by the narrowly missed encounter with an “old flame”, also identifiable with the goddess of love, Aphrodite, is far from sweet and decorous. It’s “Terrifying to almost see you again”. This recalls the cold sweat and breathless trembling that the Sappho persona of the Fragments experiences so painfully in the presence of her lover. As often happens in Seidel’s poems, with the intensification of the emotion, rhyme comes flying in the stanza’s window. Sometimes, the device seems self-protectively to defuse the emotion or at least find its potential for comedy. This seems to be happening in the fourth stanza, whose subject is confession versus concealment: “I wasn’t, but I could have been, / A god I was living in. / I chose not to come out / On stage and tell them what a poem is about”. Nothing happens but everything is transformed. The speaker dreams the raw stuff of sexual romance – the moon (“ a full moon, or nearly”), the memory of the requisite magnificent thighs and, more poignantly, “that little arrowhead of public hair”. Masturbation appears to follows the reverie (“Peaches goes it alone” is also the title of the 2018 collection in which Hymn to Aphrodite originally appeared). The lover-poet, “packing heat” and inspiration, enters a godlike state: then “the tiny hermit crab … inside a borrowed an empty shell” puts on an expensive suit and hits the 21 miles of Broadway, New York’s now-mythical theatreland. The city-slicking is ritualistic and compulsive, like the worship of Aphrodite. The poem’s diction is smart and direct, but steeped in the old-fashioned rhetoric of Greek song-culture. Aphorism encompasses love’s biggest emotional truth: “You are life stabbing death to death.” Anadiplosis, a rhetorical device based on repetition, is no small help in fuelling the rhythmic force of these quatrains. Siedel, now aged 85, is among the outstanding contemporary American poets. His New and Selected Poems, just published in the UK by Faber, is the perfect introduction to an inimitable body of work. This article was adjusted on 5 April to correct Frederick Seidel’s age.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Demands are growing for security around the houses of parliament to be enhanced as police seek to establish whether the terrorist who attacked Westminster had scouted the area for weak points. Video footage has emerged showing an entrance to the estate was left open in the immediate aftermath of Wednesday’s attack, in which five people including the attacker were killed and more than 50 injured.\\nThe footage shows the Carriage Gates, through which Khalid Masood entered the grounds of Westminster Palace where he stabbed PC Keith Palmer to death, left unguarded for several minutes. As armed officers swarm the cobbled forecourt of New Palace Yard after shooting Masood, the iron gate through which vehicles enter the yard is left wide open. No police officers are visible guarding the gates, pedestrians walk past and a courier on a moped appears to enter unchallenged. The video, obtained by the Times (£), fuelled concern that the attack could have been worse if Masood had had accomplices. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, the Conservative MP Nigel Evans said: “I’ve got no doubts whatsoever that there will be enhanced features of security, it’s happening on a regular basis, but following this tragedy, security has got to be upped at the same time as still having a welcoming hand to members of the public to come and see how democracy works.” Evans said many MPs who were locked in the Commons chamber during and after the attack were discussing how to boost security in certain areas. He said, however, that far more checks were carried out at Carriage Gates than at the time he was elected in 1992, when an officer would just “wave you through”. “I’ve got no doubts whatsoever that, under the speaker, that he is regularly in touch with the Metropolitan police, and that they will be talking about now, new security measures that will be there,” Evans said. Detectives were last night scouring large amounts of CCTV footage to see if Masood had been recorded scouting the Westminster area before his attack. The Guardian understands they are also using camera records and automatic number plate recognition technology to see if Masood was captured driving his rental car, a Hyundai four-wheel drive, around Westminster Bridge to calculate the best location to mount the kerb and inflict the most damage. At the same time, it is expected they will be looking for anyone else doing a similar thing to aid the attack, since which there have been 11 arrests and a series of vehicle seizures across the UK. The former Met commissioner Ian Blair told Today he was “absolutely certain that there will be a review now of the outer soft ring that those of us who work at the Palace of Westminster are very used to”. “Always behind it is the inner core of armed officers, but PC Keith Palmer has paid with his life for that soft outer rim and I think that his family at least, and everybody else, needs the reassurance that will be reviewed.” Lord Blair refused to criticise the officers who apparently left the gate unguarded, describing them as “human beings” who would have been “gripped completely” by the attack, while knowing armed officers were on their way. But he added: “I’m absolutely certain that there will have to be changes. People are used to the fact that if they go into Downing Street they are confronted by basically closed gates and armed officers and I’m afraid that’s what will have to happen, but we’ll leave it to the reviews to see what it is. But I don’t think there should be shock, horror about the fact the gates were open for a moment after that kind of attack.” Parliamentary authorities have previously been warned about the potential vulnerability of Carriage Gates. Around 5,000 people work on the estate and about 14,000 people hold parliamentary passes, while hundreds of visitors enter the building each day. On Friday, Mark Rowley, Scotland Yard’s anti-terror chief, said current arrangements were proportionate and that procedures for guarding parliament had been designed so they were not “overly intrusive”. “Our current arrangements have been developed with parliament over many years and are designed to provide access to the seat of our government balanced with security that is proportionate but not overly intrusive,” he said. The prime minister also defended security arrangements at parliament on Thursday, saying the UK should be clear that the attacker was unsuccessful in gaining access to the building. The security expert Prof Anthony Glees told the Guardian the attack had demonstrated a “lack of protection” within parliament, while there were “disturbing signs of chaos” in the way May was taken away from the estate. Counter-terrorism detectives have been investigating Masood’s life and associations across Britain in a race to discover what led him to run down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, crash his vehicle outside parliament and attack two police officers. A joint investigation by Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command and MI5 led to three further arrests on Thursday and early Friday in London, Birmingham and Manchester, with two of them still in custody. Properties were searched in Wales and southern England. It remains unclear whether the attack was carried out alone or with support or encouragement. Fears have heightened that Masood was either radicalised overseas or in prison. The Saudi embassy in London confirmed late on Friday that Masood had been in the country three times and taught English there, from November 2005 to November 2006, from April 2008 to April 2009, and for six days in March 2015. He had a work visa and was not tracked by Saudi security services because he didn’t have a criminal record in the country.\\nBut the 52-year-old, born Adrian Elms, was known at home for having a violent temper and had criminal convictions in the UK. A childhood friend told The Sun newspaper Masood had converted to Islam while in jail. “When he first came out he told me he’d become a Muslim in prison and I thought he was joking,” Mark Ashdown said. “Then I saw he was quieter and much more serious. I gave him some cash-in-hand work for a few months as a labourer. “He said he needed time to pray and read the Qur’an – something about finding inner peace. There were still flashes of the old Ade, but they were few and far between. “I heard he’d split from his partner and got even more deeply into religion. But nothing could have prepared me for hearing his name on the radio.” Detectives have so far seized 2,700 items as part of the investigation, including “massive amounts” of computer data, while they have had contact with around 3,500 witnesses. Searches at three addresses are continuing.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The federal government is paying a public relations firm $2.9m to help with its vaccine rollout for five months, including by copying vaccine data from its website and putting it in an email for journalists. The health department has previously refused to say how much it was paying Cox Inall Change, a public relations company, for the simple task of attaching a pdf copy of its vaccine data to an email to media outlets every day.\\nThe department’s contract with Cox Inall Change, published last week, shows the firm is receiving $2.9m as a “public relations agency to support Covid vaccine communication work” between August and the end of December. The money is not just paying for the daily emails to media. The firm is performing other communications work for government with a focus on reducing vaccine hesitancy. But the department has previously refused to answer questions about how much the daily email service is costing it or whether outsourcing it offers taxpayers value-for-money, particularly given the size of its own communications team. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\\n“Cox Inall has been contracted as part of the broader communications campaign,” the department said earlier this month. “They are undertaking a range of tasks including information booths at shopping centres to support people who wish to book a vaccination appointment to broader communications to support the vaccination program.” It said the daily data published by the Operation Covid Shield taskforce on the department’s website, and shared by Cox Inall in the daily emails, was an “accurate and up to date picture of the actual state of play with the rollout”.\\nThe firm sends the data in the same form, a pdf, as it is published on the website and adds no additional detail or context. It does not provide the data in more easily accessible formats for data analysts. “I am reaching out on behalf of the Australian government (department of health) to provide you with the latest data on total vaccine doses,” Cox Inall says in the daily email. “Our team will be sending an updated deck through to your newsroom each day to ensure you are up to date with the latest data for the Covid-19 vaccine rollout.” Cox Inall declined to comment. The health department said Cox Inall was conducting a range of communications activities for the government, including holding information booths at major sporting events. “A key role is to provide content for social media including videos such as those who have survived Covid and encouraging others to be vaccinated,” a spokesperson said. “Cox Inall’s role in providing information directly to newsrooms is important in ensuring the Australian public has accurate vaccine rollout information and such activities are standard practise for PR companies to undertake as part of the support role they are playing for the Department.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>‘Actively develop friendship’: China’s new ambassador to Australia strikes softer tone</td>\n",
       "      <td>China’s new ambassador to Australia has offered an olive branch in the intense diplomatic dispute between the two countries, saying they should “meet each other halfway” and “look into the future”. Xiao Qian, who arrived in Canberra in January after years of increasing tensions, said China attached “great importance” to the relationship and was willing to “actively develop friendship and cooperation with Australia”. The intervention comes just days after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, accused China of a dangerous “act of intimidation” over a Chinese warship’s shining of a laser at a RAAF surveillance plane north of Australia last week.\\nChina’s national defence ministry, in turn, accused the Australian defence force of “spiteful and provocative actions”. Xiao said in a speech on Thursday that the healthy and stable development of China-Australia relations served the fundamental interests and “common aspirations” of people in both countries. Given this year marked the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties, he said, there was an opportunity to ease tensions. “China is willing to work with Australia to meet each other halfway,” said Xiao, who previously was China’s ambassador to Indonesia. He said the two governments should “jointly make efforts” to push the relationship back on “the right track”. They should “review the past” and also “look into the future”. Xiao did not specify any tangible actions Beijing may take to get the relationship back on track – but clearly signalled he wants to talk. Later, he told SBS World News and the ABC: “The diplomatic channel is open.”\\nAustralian ministers have complained since early 2020 they have been unable to secure phone calls or meetings with their direct counterparts – although contacts have continued to occur at lower diplomatic levels. The Australian government accuses Beijing of engaging in “economic coercion” by hitting a range of Australian export sectors with tariffs, bans or other sanctions in 2020 – some of which are being challenged at the World Trade Organization. Both major political parties in Australia view the differences in the relationship with China as largely structural and therefore not something that can be fixed by adopting a different tone. China is particularly sensitive to criticism about human rights and the crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong and Australia’s longstanding position against using force or the threat of force to bring Taiwan under Beijing’s control. In recent months, Beijing has ramped up its criticism of new or renewed groupings such as the Quad and Aukus. Still, Xiao’s comments signalled a more open approach to dialogue, and contrast with a warning from his predecessor Cheng Jingye in April last year that Beijing would respond “in kind” if Australia followed other countries in imposing sanctions against its officials over human rights abuses in Xinjiang. On Wednesday, the former Australian foreign minister Julie Bishop added her voice to calls for Australia’s foreign policy and national security to “always be, as far as possible, bipartisan”. Bishop’s comments to the ABC’s 7.30 program follow growing attempts by the Morrison government to argue a point of difference with Labor over China in the lead-up to the May election. Politicisation of national security also triggered carefully worded pushback from the Asio chief, Mike Burgess. Xiao was speaking at an event at the Chinese embassy in Canberra to present the family of the late New South Wales police force officer Kelly Foster with a medal honouring her bravery. Foster died trying to save Chinese student Jennifer Qi in a whirlpool in the Blue Mountains in January last year. Qi also lost her life. Xiao told the audience – which included senior Australian federal police and NSW police force representatives – that Foster had displayed “the warmth of great love and humanity that transcend race, culture and nationality”.\\n“China and Australia are far away from each other geographically, by thousands of miles, yet great love knows no national boundaries nor distance,” the ambassador said. He said Foster’s “heroic act” had been widely reported in China, where millions of people “could feel the warmth, kindness and friendship of the Australian people”. The NSW police commissioner, Karen Webb, said the force felt the loss deeply. “It is a testament to her courage that she went immediately to Jennifer’s aid without a second’s thought for her own safety,” Webb said. Foster was posthumously awarded the Great Wall Commemorative Medal of China’s Ministry of Public Security. The national anthems of both China and Australia were played at the embassy event.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Sunak’s opening remarks Rishi Sunak says his budget delivers a stronger economy for the British people: stronger growth, public finances and employment. The chancellor says he will give people the support they need with the cost of living and levelling up. He says the budget does not draw a line under Covid but does begin the work of building an economy post-pandemic. “Let there be no doubt: our plan is working,” he says. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: Sunak has adopted the prime minister’s claims that the UK needs to move to a “new economic model” of higher wages and productivity. He is sounding decidedly like a Johnsonian optimist, trumpeting better than expected economic growth, rather than focusing on fiscal discipline or balancing the books. He does, however, inject a note of caution about the threat of inflation, while insisting it is a global problem. Inflation The chancellor says inflationary pressures are affecting the UK economy, with the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasting that inflation will be above 4% next year. He says the pressures are global in nature and are “impossible for us to address alone”. However, the government will act to support households, he says. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: Sunak says he has written to the Bank of England re-emphasising its remit on maintaining low and stable inflation. The measures to help struggling households are likely to be the flagship policy in the budget, with Labour warning they need to be immediate to help people through the winter.\\nGrowth The chancellor says forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility show the economy will grow by 6.5% this year. Sunak says it will take until the start of 2022 for the economy to return to its pre-pandemic size. GDP will grow by 6% next year, 2.1% in 2023, 1.3% in 2024, 1.6% in 2025, and 1.7% in 2026. In March, the OBR had forecast growth of 4% this year, after a plunge of 9.9% in 2020 – the worst recession for 300 years. The OBR’s estimate for long-term scarring for the economy has been revised down from 3% to 2%. Unemployment is forecast to peak at 5.2% in the fourth quarter of 2021. In July 2020, the OBR had forecast unemployment would peak close to 12% by the end of that year due to the end of furlough. However, the scheme was extended until the end of September 2021. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: This is much better than expected, giving Sunak more room for manoeuvre on spending than he previously thought.\\nBorrowing Sunak says borrowing in the current financial year, 2021-22, will be 7.9% of GDP, and will fall to 3.3% next year. In cash terms, the OBR forecasts borrowing will be £183bn, and fall to £83bn in 2022-23 Borrowing in the last financial year, 2020-21, was estimated at £319bn, or 15.2% of GDP, the highest recorded level in peacetime. Debt levels will fall as a share of national income, from 98.2% in the current financial year to 88% by 2026-27 The chancellor says he is setting new “fiscal rules” for management of the public finances. Debt must fall as a percentage of GDP. In “normal times” the state should only borrow to invest in future growth, balancing everyday spending. This must happen by the third year of each forecast period. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: Fiscal rules seem to change almost annually these days, as new chancellors tweak their parameters to suit their aims and ideology. Sunak says he is on track to hit the new rules, which appears to be hardly surprising given that he has just devised them for himself. They will give him more flexibility on borrowing than the previous rules and contain caveats about only applying “in normal times”.\\nSpending review Sunak says there will be a real-terms rise for every government department. Departmental spending in this parliament will rise by £150bn, in the “largest increase this century”. Spending will grow in real terms by 3.8% a year. Sunak says: “If anybody still doubts it, today’s budget confirms it. The Conservatives are the real party of public services.” The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates average real-terms annual growth in departmental resource budgets was higher in previous years, above 4% in 2000 and 2002 under Labour, and 4.1% under the Conservatives in 2019. There will be grant funding for local government of £4.8bn, the “largest increase in core funding for over a decade”. Overseas aid will return to 0.7% of GDP by the end of the parliament, after a cut to 0.5% announced last year. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: The real-terms rise in budgets for government departments is more generous than expected, with the Institute for Fiscal Studies having previously warned that some could have been facing a squeeze. Part of this is likely to go on increases in spending on pay for public sector workers and to cover the rise in the national living wage. Education Sunak says funding for each pupil will be returned to 2010 levels, in an increase worth £1,500 a pupil. The government is tripling investment to create 30,000 special school places, he confirms. Total support for catchup funding because of the Covid pandemic will be almost £5bn. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: The extra money for schools is a new announcement that had not been trailed in the run-up to the budget. However, an increase in school funding to 2010 levels shows it has taken more than decade to return to previous levels after Tory austerity.\\nLevelling up Sunak announces £1.7bn of funding in the first grants from the Treasury’s Levelling Up Fund, for towns and cities including Stoke-on-Trent, Leeds, Doncaster and Leicester. The funding includes allocations to constituencies held by the Labour leadership, he indicates: “We’re so committed to levelling up we’re even levelling up the opposition front bench.” Libraries will be “renovated, restored and revived”. Tax relief on museums and galleries was due to be announced in March next year; it will be extended until March 2024. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: There is a clear message here from Sunak that he is opting for “investment” rather than “retrenchment” – or spending over austerity. The main aim of Johnson’s premiership is to retain the seats he won in the Midlands and north at the next election, with the “levelling-up” argument clearly aimed at this audience. Infrastructure and investment The chancellor says he will increase investment to support London-style transport across the regions of England. The government will invest £21bn on roads and £46bn on railways to improve journey times between cities. Sunak announces the government’s target for hitting research and development spending will reach £22bn by 2026-27, two years later than had been initially planned. The government will invest £20bn in R&amp;D by 2024-25. Sunak says this stands as a “record investment to secure the UK’s future as a global science superpower”. Sunak announces he will limit tax relief for business R&amp;D spending so that it only applies to domestic activities. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: Sunak is trumpeting billions of pounds more in investment spending. The small print will have to be examined to look at how much of this is new money but he does appear to have gone down the road of big capital spending with the aim of boosting growth. Experts also pointed out the timings mean a target on hitting science funding would not be met until two years later than planned. Employment and skills The chancellor says the government will raise government spending on skills and training by £3.8bn over the parliament, an increase of 42%. He confirms the government will launch a UK-wide numeracy service called Multiply. He says the programme will help 500,000 adults improve their numeracy. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: Skills is not a very voter-friendly topic but the government considers improving lifelong learning a key part of improving productivity. Much of this had been pre-briefed but the 43% increase in spending is nonetheless striking. Brexit Sunak says changes after Brexit will encourage British merchant shipping lines to fly red ensign flags. He jokes that this means “red flags are still flying somewhere in this country, even if they are all at sea”. Internal domestic flights will have air passenger duty cut. He says 9 million passengers will have their duty cut by half, “bringing people together across the UK”. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: This minor measure gives Sunak an opportunity for his first joke – not a very funny one – saying Labour will be pleased to see a red flag flying. The air passenger duty cut seems ill-judged in the run-up to the Cop26 climate change conference, as it will encourage people to take carbon-intensive short-haul flights rather than train journeys. Business taxes The chancellor confirms that the bank surcharge will be cut from 8% to 3%. Sunak says changes to business rates will be reformed to support companies, including a new 12-month relief for firms to invest in their premises. The chancellor says the investment incentives are worth £750m. Next year’s planned increase in the business rates multiplier will be cancelled. That is worth £4.6bn over the next five years, he says. Sunak announces a 50% business rates discount for companies in retail, hospitality and leisure sectors, up to a maximum of £110,000. It is a cut worth £1.7bn. The chancellor says: “This is the biggest single year tax cut to business rates in over 30 years.” Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: Tory MPs have been lobbying on this to support high street shops hit by the pandemic. Many small businesses will be pretty pleased with this and backbench Conservatives will be very happy to take this back to their constituents. Pubs and alcohol duty Sunak announces radical changes for alcohol duty, in what he calls the biggest changes for 140 years. The UK’s main duty rates on alcohol will be cut from 15 to six in a simplified system. Higher-strength alcoholic drinks will attract higher duties, including stronger red wines, fortified wines and high-strength ciders. Lower-strength drinks – such as rosé, fruit ciders and liqueurs – will attract a lower tax rate than currently. Pubs and bars will benefit from a new “draught relief” cutting duty on beer and cider sold in pubs by the most since 1923. The cost of a pint will be permanently cut by 3p. There will be a small brewers’ relief, including for cider makers. The chancellor says the reforms are taking advantage of leaving the EU to simplify the system. The chancellor says alcohol duties are “full of historical anomalies” as it dates back to 1643. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: There is a logic to these changes, punishing higher alcohol products and rewarding lower alcohol ones. However, it does little for non-drinkers and the overall measures are a revenue loser for the Treasury, meaning an overall cut to alcohol duty despite the negative impact of drinking on public health.\\nCost of living The chancellor says an increase in fuel duty will be cancelled, saving motorists £8bn over five years. After 12 years of freezing fuel duty it will save the average motorist £1,900. The chancellor confirms the national living wage will increase from £8.91 to £9.50 an hour from April. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: This is pitched as a measure to help struggling families. But cancelling a fuel duty increase is yet another measure that runs counter to the government’s narrative on tackling the climate emergency ahead of the Cop26 climate summit next week. Taxation and universal credit Sunak announces that he will cut the taper rate in universal credit from 63p to 55p. This will be worth more than £2bn. The work allowance will be increased by £500. The chancellor says this will be implemented no later than 1 December. It comes after the government cut universal credit by £20 a week from early October after a temporary uplift during the coronavirus pandemic, in a cut worth £6bn. Sunak says his “goal” is to reduce taxes by the end of the parliament. He says: “By the end of this parliament I want taxes to be going down, not up.” Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: Sunak is sounding most passionate as he throws some red meat to Tory backbenchers promising tax cuts in future. He goes on to announce reforms to the universal credit system that will enable those in work to keep more of what they own. It goes some way towards reversing the £20-a-week universal credit cut but only for those in work, not those out of work. It feeds in the Conservative narrative of encouraging employment but ignores the plight of some of those struggling the most. What Sunak didn’t mention The chancellor offered no direct support for soaring household energy bills after ruling out a cut in VAT for gas and electricity. Substantial green measures were missing from the budget, including carbon taxes and spending plans above and beyond details announced last week for reaching net zero. Business leaders had wanted more extensive reforms to business rates, including to support high street shops competing with online retailers. However, the Treasury merely said it would “explore the arguments for and against” an online sales tax. Sunak did not announce any decisions on HS2, or on high-speed rail across the north of England, known as HS3. The chancellor indicated he would cut taxes in the run-up to the next election, although did not spell out where he felt such changes were appropriate. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: The lack of measures to help with energy bills was surprising given that this is going to be the biggest visible increase in household costs this winter, with rises over around 12%. There was no cut to VAT on energy bills – once promised by Brexiters – and not even any targeted increase to the warm homes discount for poorer households. This is a gamble, given the only other help for people struggling with their bills was a cut in alcohol duties and those lower paid on universal credit. The lack of big business tax reforms was perhaps a sign that Sunak has no appetite for any controversial shake-ups when he has so much else on his plate.</td>\n",

       "      <td>It’s 2012 and I’m at Wimbledon chatting with Serena Williams. We’re recording an interview for BBC radio and she’s telling me about her new wristband which measures movement, heart rate, calories, even sleep quality. The technology is staggering. I find myself wondering if I should get one, despite the fact that only last week I bought myself a Garmin running watch that cost hundreds of pounds and offered many of the same features. I’m so absorbed by this conundrum, I realise that I’ve forgotten to listen to Serena, who stopped speaking several seconds ago and is now looking at me rather oddly. An increasingly awkward silence is filling the tiny interview room. I panic and accidentally ask her the same question again. How had I got here? To a point where I was ignoring the greatest female tennis player in the world to indulge my mania for running tech? Cycling, fishing, golf… certain sports come with a love of equipment as standard. But running is meant to be simpler, isn’t it? The purest form of exercise. Just lace up your shoes and get out there. When Pheidippides made that dash from Marathon to Athens, he probably wasn’t wearing compression tights. I only started running because I was plumping out in my mid-30s. I failed to reach the end of the street on my first-ever run – I set off too fast, paused for a wheeze outside a friend’s house, and ended up walking back home. But then I fell for it hard. I soon realised running was doing much more for me than just keeping the weight off. It gave me space – mental, emotional and physical. If I wanted to solve a nagging problem, I’d go for a run. If I was feeling tired, anxious, lethargic, I’d go for a run. The benefits were making themselves felt in every part of my life. I was soon doing it every day, often twice.\\nWithin a few years, I was cheerfully signing up for ultra marathons and triathlons (I once attempted one of each on the same weekend). I discovered I was living in a golden age of the runner. Back in the 80s, when people went out for a jog, all you needed was a tracksuit – accessorised, perhaps, with a headband and matching sweatbands. The only piece of tech you required was a Walkman to keep you moving to the beat of “Eye of the Tiger”. But now that “jogging” has transformed into the more serious pursuit of “running”, there was endless kit to be had. The tech crept into my life in increments. It started with the quest for the perfect pair of shoes. Then came the base layers – top and tights – that promised to be “injury reducing, temperature controlling and moisture managing”. Clearly these were completely vital. They were also £90 a pop, but hey – I’d get added value with each run. Next, socks. Another £40, but that’s money well spent when you consider that the ones I chose were “not only the result of tireless research work, they were also the subject of a doctoral thesis”.\\nMost weeks I’d emerge from a running shop armed with another must-have accessory. Sure, I was setting myself tougher and tougher running goals. But did I really need a hydration backpack to help me achieve them? Or hi-vis gloves and a £400 GPS watch? My transformation from “someone who went for a run” to “runner” was accompanied by the kind of monomania that characterises both Olympic athletes and middle-aged men in Lycra. My growing collection of running-related paraphernalia was fast becoming obscene. It’s a generally accepted truth that men love to feed our sporting hobbies with exorbitant, extravagant equipment: and we love to talk about our newest discoveries and acquisitions. As a sports reporter in regular encounters with professional athletes I suffered acutely. I think it was one of the Brownlee brothers – the world champion triathletes – who told me about sweat analysis and an isotonic drink which exactly replicates the minerals lost during exercise. I spent ages trying (and eventually failing) to find somewhere to create the same for me. But I did have my gait analysed in a lab in Oxford to check for minuscule deviations from the ideal which might lead to a niggle. As a result, my orthotics were custom made in Canada. And that Nike band Serena Williams talked about? I bought one, of course. After all, who doesn’t want to have something in common with Serena? You’d think all this gadgetry would be making my runs more enjoyable. But instead they were becoming more stressful. Dressed in my lurid gear, I’d stand in the middle of the road waiting for my watch to find a satellite signal. Even during a supposedly easy run, I’d check it every few minutes to discover how fast I was going – and all too frequently would end up berating myself mid-run. In the end, as I wandered around outside my front door scowling at London’s pesky, signal-obstructing buildings while impatiently waving my wrist at the clouds, I would be secretly dreading the hour or so that lay ahead of me.\\nAs for the races, every marathon became nothing more than a failure to achieve my ultimate goal – to finish in under three hours. Gone were the days when running 26.2 miles gave me any sense of achievement. It took me a while to work out that running stops being pleasurable – and stops being a release of tension, stops being an escape, an act of discovery and self-discovery – if you’re constantly stressing about how fast you’re travelling, what you’re wearing, what your heart rate is doing. Proper analysis is crucial for elite athletes. But I had lost the most elemental reason for my run – the sense of pleasure and diversion. Running can be simple and child-like and brilliant. The watch and the gear were keeping me away from that. They had to go. For a while they festered in the back of a cupboard. Then came a flash of endorphin-fuelled clarity after a fell run, and I bundled them all up and gave them to a local charity shop. Fast forward to a beautiful spring morning near Keswick, cresting the top of a fell and suddenly, unfolding into my gaze, the sublime radiance of the Lake District. All of England seemed to lie below, and I forgot about my aching thighs, sniffed the unpolluted air and enjoyed the sensation of soft earth under my feet. I realised, in that moment, there was nowhere else I’d rather be, and nothing else I’d rather be doing. I’m no expert, but isn’t that what they call mindfulness? I once interviewed a sports psychologist with a deeply impressive client list. He quoted Leonardo da Vinci: “Simplicity,” he told me. “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” Don’t Stop Me Now: 26.2 Tales of a Runner’s Obsession by Vassos Alexander (Bloomsbury, £12.99).

       "      <td>Tens of millions of pounds have been wasted on a major failed hospital closure programme, according to an internal NHS document passed to the Guardian. A confidential, draft document circulated to NHS North West London Collaboration of Clinical Commissioning Groups, which serves more than 2 million Londoners, admits the blueprint for one of the NHS’s largest planned reorganisations has failed. “NHS commissioners and providers in north-west London have therefore decided to draw the SaHF [Shaping a Healthier Future] programme to a conclusion,” the document states. The proposal was a flagship for reorganisation of the NHS in England when it was launched in 2012 and involved a reduction in the number of acute hospitals in eight London boroughs from nine to five. Julian Bell, the leader of Ealing council, described it as “a monstrous plan”. It was part of NHS strategy at the time to replace some acute hospitals with care provided in the community. The document states that £76m has been spent on management consultants for the failed scheme from 2010-11 until the end of 2018. It outlines how health officials can respond to difficult questions that may be asked about the failed scheme. It also discusses preparing people for new changes as part of the NHS’ long-term plan, which the document states will involve “difficult decisions and trade offs”. SaHF argued that four acute hospitals in – Hammersmith, Central Middlesex, Charing Cross and Ealing – could be downgraded. The proposal involved the loss of more than 600 acute hospital beds. The document reports there has been a reduction of just seven hospital beds in the last six years. The closure of Charing Cross was particularly controversial after plans were revealed to sell off 87% of the valuable central London site by the Guardian. But in March the health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced that plans to close A&amp;E departments at Charing Cross and Ealing hospitals would no longer go ahead. The document says: “Continued growth in demand for acute care, despite investment in primary and community services, a growing underlying budget deficit and shortfalls in our ability to recruit and retain enough staff with the right skills’ means that the plan, as originally envisaged, is no longer viable.” It provides statistics about an increase of 227,288 in A&amp;E attendances across north-west London since 2012 – a 4% rise per year, with a 2018-19 waiting list of 177,395 patients, which would require the provision of 95 extra beds for a year to clear the backlog. The document adds there has been a 40% increase in patients waiting for non-urgent surgery. It reveals how officials plan to “spin” this failure by citing improvements such as 100 new midwives and 90 new children’s nurses. In the document, under the heading “incorrect/sorry”, the question “Will anyone resign over this?” is posed and the answer provided is “no”. The response to the question “What have you learned from this and how will you change the way you make decisions in the future to ensure millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money isn’t wasted?” is “??”. The notion that some acute hospitals can be closed because NHS care can instead be provided in the community has been refuted in various independent studies including a report from the Nuffield Trust which dispels some of the myths around this “magic bullet”. Merril Hammer, secretary of Hammersmith &amp; Fulham Save Our Hospitals, said: “The leaked paper is extraordinary. This was the biggest reorganisation project the NHS has ever seen. We still don’t know how much it has cost in total. Since the initial plans were drawn up, campaigners asked for the evidence that ‘out of hospital’ provision could reduce the need for acute hospital beds. This was never produced.” Cllr Ben Coleman, chair of Hammersmith and Fulham’s health and wellbeing board, said: “This leaked document confirms that SaHF was a grotesque waste of time and public money, which threatened life-saving health services.” A spokeswoman for NHS North West London Collaboration of CCGs said some of the spending on management consultants predated April 2013, when the CCGs were set up, so could not be verified. “North West London CCG’s spend on consultancies for the SaHF programme was £43m between April 2013 … and March 2019. There are now strict controls on management consultancy expenditure and we are not currently incurring consultancy costs for the development of our future plans, nor do we intend to.” She highlighted achievements of SaHF including the transformation of paediatric and maternity services in north-west London and an increase in children being treated without admission to a hospital ward. She added that while SaHF was no longer going forward and was being replaced with the NHS long-term plan, “we will however continue to learn and incorporate lessons from the previous programme into future work”.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Maray, 91 Bold Street, Liverpool L1 4HF (0151 709 5820). Meal for two, including drinks and service: £60 In keeping with the current vogue on campus, this review comes with a trigger warning. At some point over the next 1,100 words, I believe I am going to come across as grossly patronising, sodden with metropolitan disdain and lousy with condescension. This, in turn, could trigger in many of you outbreaks of acute eye-rolling and sighing. To be fair, none of this is very different from usual. It’s just going to be more obvious this week. This is because I am overwhelmed by the impulse to tell you exactly what went through my head during the entire process of booking and eating at Maray in Liverpool, rather than dressing it up with some faux out-of-London friendly niceties to make myself sound better. This may not always be pretty.\\nThe fact is I never intended to review the place. I booked in because I had a show to do that night and, unlike most of the other restaurants in Liverpool, Maray was prepared to take a 9.30pm booking. (I whinged on Twitter about how hard it was to find somewhere to eat post 9pm outside London; I was met with the quite reasonable response from chefs that my struggle was as nothing compared to theirs to find enough customers willing to do so.) Their ability to take that booking – in my own name; as I say I wasn’t planning to write about it – even trumped my suspicion of the language used on the website. Because apparently they had not merely written their menu. They had “curated” the damn thing. Oh God. I’ve whinged about this before, but that’s not going to stop me doing so again. The word curate is not a synonym for “chosen” or “collected”. If it was, then in recent weeks I have curated the contents of my fridge, my underwear drawer and my prejudices. It must be infuriating to all the genuine curators in museums the world over, pursuing their calling with dedication and experience, that every half-arsed cocktail jockey, stove monkey or DJ has co-opted the term to make their jobs sound better. I suppose saying you curate contemporary sounds for an athletic body movement-aware demimonde does sound a bit better than: “I put on records in a nightclub.”\\nExcept, having eaten at Maray, I am willing to acknowledge that there is something akin to curation going on here. They have curated a load of the best stuff currently omnipresent in London, and brought it here. The restaurant’s name is apparently a phonetic realisation of the Marais district of Paris. There, in the tight knot of streets just behind the Bastille, long one of the city’s Jewish areas, the three young founders were much taken by the falafel joints. They wanted to bring something of that back to Liverpool. And the falafel at Maray, apparently made from scratch every day rather than with chickpea flour, is a marvellous thing: crisp outside, puffing a sweet nuttiness from inside as you break them open. They come with a smear of hummus punched up with the fire of harissa and, for ballast, a little tabbouleh. Flatbreads are delivered to the table soft and warm. But what’s really interesting is the rest of the menu. This is a small plates, sharing portions gaff, the sort of thing you can’t move for in Dalston and Peckham. What’s extremely clever, however, is that it manages to cover seemingly every genre going. So, while the flavours of the Middle Eastern grill house do predominate, it’s also a bit Skandi and a bit pimped American junk food. It is all the clichés that we have become very used to in the capital across multiple restaurants, only crammed into one. In the hands of a lesser kitchen this could be a car crash, complete with tyre marks, collapsed lamp posts and distraught witnesses; a cacophony of plates, each of which is a fumble of the genuine article. But Maray does all of these things very well indeed, and at an exceptionally good price. Most dishes cost £6 or a little less.\\nFrom the Middle Eastern end of the menu comes a lump of roasted cauliflower with high smoky notes, dressed with tahini, yogurt, more harissa, flaked almonds and the sweet burst of pomegranate seeds. The much-lauded Palomar in London’s Soho does this. Maray does it equally well, but much cheaper. From the same side of the menu comes thumb-thick pieces of butternut squash, roasted until caramelised and soft, and dressed with cooling tahini and the sweet-sour punch of a sticky balsamic reduction. Planks of seared wild mushroom come on a buttery purée of the same and dressed with the aromatics of dukkah, until they smell like an old spice shop in a Turkish bazaar.\\nNext up something from northern latitudes, bringing a lightness to the darker flavours of the Middle East: pristine cubes of beetroot and gin-cured trout, with the crunch of pickled cucumber, which reminds me of the food at Rök a couple of weeks back. Non-meat dishes predominate here – Monday’s are completely meat free – but from the short list we get their buttermilk fried chicken, made with thigh meat as it should be, and drizzled with a spiced honey. God, but it’s good: crispy, salty and sweet. So that’s a nod to Spuntino or Rita’s. Heads of kale are deep fried and dressed with salt and chilli. They crumble and puff to nothing in our mouths and are completely addictive.\\nThere are just two desserts including a plum and pear cheesecake which we are told is “deconstructed”. That’s the kind of thing which could make me a bit punchy and shouty. Couldn’t you just make a real one? But I rather like the bowl of whipped sweetened cream with a fruit purée and a kind of biscuit gravel. It’s not a cheesecake and has no hope of ever being one, but it’s extremely edible. The room is long and narrow and has distressed brickwork on one side and white walls the other, hung with edgy pop art. The tables are made from reclaimed doors and sewing machine stands. The kitchen is half open and staffed by a bearded man. Some of the wines are biodynamic. Well, of course they are. But that’s OK. Liverpool’s restaurant sector is expanding. Interesting things are happening. But, right now, it’s unlikely it could support three small sharing-plate joints covering, say, the Middle East, Scandinavia and the US. Happily, it doesn’t need to. Because down on Bold Street there’s a place called Maray. And it’s doing the job just fine. Jay’s news bites ■ The Palomar, at the unsexy end of London’s Rupert Street, has managed the rare trick of creating a vibe without letting it overwhelm the food. Sit at the bar, back chat with the chefs, drink shots and enjoy the Israeli-influenced food, such as the Jerusalem mix of chicken livers, hearts and veal sweetbreads seared with okra, tomato and tahini (thepalomar.co.uk). ■ Given the excitement around steaks from long-lived Spanish dairy cows, it was only time before a British equivalent emerged. Butcher Salter &amp; King of Aldeburgh, Suffolk is selling meat from a 12-year-old Lincoln Red. ‘The colour is dark and intense,’ says Gerard King, ‘and the yellow fat runs lightly right through the meat.’ They deliver nationwide (salterandking.co.uk). ■ Ping Coombes, who won MasterChef in 2014, has surfaced in her first restaurant role. She is consulting on the menu at Chi Kitchen, located in Debenhams on London’s Oxford Street. It will finally make her famed laksa available to the public (chikitchen.co.uk).

       "      <td>Commentator Joe Hildebrand informed me this morning that one of my Twitter followers is a murderer. He can’t tell me which one, of course. He’s speaking statistically, not to me direct, in a comment piece he published to justify the remarks he made on Studio 10 earlier this week. In the show Hildebrand was in a conversation with activist Phil Cleary, held in the wake of another brutal alleged murder of a woman, Courtney Herron. Victoria Assistant Police Commissioner Luke Cornelius has said “violence against women is absolutely about men’s behaviour”. Cleary – whose own sister was murdered by a man in 1987 – urged the need for men to collectively address the sexism of pervasive cultural traditions. The overwhelming narrative of the culture we’ve inherited still positions women as expendable objects, deserving of lesser status while defining “masculinity” as a capacity for physical force and brutality. The moral obligation of men who didn’t want women to be murdered, argued Cleary, was “to explain to men everywhere how we’ve got to revisit our relationship to women and the position of women in society”. Hildebrand took umbrage. “I don’t really understand where this is coming from,” he said. “There is nothing dark in my heart.” “I didn’t say in your heart,” responded Cleary, in a conversation that was supposed to be about the murder of a woman in the context of a culture that deprioritises women and which lasted precisely 4.23 seconds before it was suddenly about Joe Hildebrand. It was the perfect demonstration of what has long been known on the internet – yes, for nearly a decade – as the “not all men” meme. When Vox was writing about when men “remind the speaker that ‘not all men’ do something, they derail what could be a productive conversation … and that little qualifier … recentres their feelings as the central part of the dialogue” it was in 2014, not actually this week. Hildebrand went on to refer to himself 43 times in the subsequent five minutes of discussion.\\nOn both the issue and the personalisation, he has doubled down. “I was asked what I thought about Victoria police’s comments,” he began, “I thought it was a really nonsensical thing to say.” Only one in 23,000 men are murderers, he said, so “is mass reflection of this really going to stop that one man from killing?” The police, advocacy organisations and the recommendations of a royal commission suggest, well, yes. They have decades of research to draw on, like that mentioned here, here, here, here, here and here. The persistency of unequal gender roles are overwhelmingly the conditioning factor for gender-based violence. Either we can truthfully have the conversation about how we work together to transform the social understanding of those gender roles or – do what, exactly? We all just have to live with the fact that every community in Australia with 23,000 men in it – from a Twitter follower count to a Facebook page, a football club to a country town – contains a murderer? Research be damned, let’s not do anything about it? Let’s allow more than 100 male murderers to wander Sydney alone … before, of course, we add to their number the rapists, the bashers, the abusers, the thousands and thousands of men at the end of #MeToo allegations, the criminals who don’t even register in the crime statistics because women maintain some strange notion that people don’t take crimes against them seriously. “People still commit murder” despite powerful disincentives, writes someone who probably by now should have heard of an “anti-terrorism initiative”. But, pfft, whatever, don’t get het up about this dead women stuff. Roll with what life gives you, folks. Chillax. There is something more precise to be identified from these events than is covered just by their inclusion in the #NotAllMen discourse. This what I would call the Masculine Insistence Paradox – a man passionately refuses to share responsibility for the perpetration of sexist narratives and dangerous gender roles and by doing so affirms both. “I don’t see how me reflecting on myself is going to stop women being bashed or murdered,” the man said. No, you don’t, Joe. And – I really hate to say it – but maybe that’s something we should all discuss. Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnist</td>\n",

       "      <td>With Luis Suárez about to be unceremoniously shown the door at the Nou Camp, in a state of affairs that is believed to be one of many reasons behind his best pal Leo Messi’s decision to hand in a transfer request, Manchester City striker Gabriel Jesus has been identified as a potential replacement by Barcelona for the Uruguayan striker. Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain are both reported to be interested in signing Messi, although Manchester City are reported to be in the box-seat with one tabloid reporting the player’s father is already in talks with the club. In the increasingly likely event of Messi’s departure from the club he has served for 20 years, it remains to be seen who will be given the unenviable and frankly impossible task of filling his Adidas Nemeziz 19.1s. By his own lofty standards N’Golo Kanté had a fairly underwhelming season punctuated by injury at Chelsea but that hasn’t put off Internazionale, whose policy of rehoming Premier League stars has enjoyed more than a modicum of success. The Serie A side need to offload another high profile player before they can bring him in and Lautaro Martinez, Milan Skriniar and Marcelo Brozovic are among those they would consider letting go to help fund the deal.\\nHighly regarded QPR midfielder Eberechi Eze looks set to leave Loftus Road for pastures new, specifically the lush green rectangle of grass at Selhurst Park. Sky Sports News have reported the Crystal Palace have agreed a fee of £16m rising to £20m, with the Championships side insisting on a 20% sell-on clause that could yield them a pretty penny in years to come. Wolves full-back Matt Doherty is also on the move to Tottenham after 10 years of faithful service at Molineux. A fee of £15m has been agreed and Doherty’s former League of Ireland club Bohemians – for whom he never actually made a senior appearance – are in line for a bumper pay-day on the back of a clause they shrewdly included in the transfer deal between themselves and Wolves a decade ago.\\nResigned to losing Doherty, Wolves are in search of a replacement and have identified Arsenal’s Ainsley Maitland-Niles as the man for the job. An initial bid of £15m for the 22-year-old has been rejected, with the Emirates beancounters confident they can hold out for a few quid more. Celtic’s already slim chances of holding on to Odsonne Édouard suffered a major blow following their meek exit from the Champions League at the hands of Hungarian side Ferencvaros. The striker missed last night’s humiliation at Celtic Park, apparently through injury, but has been heavily linked with a move to Aston Villa. Crystal Palace, Leicester City and Arsenal are also reported to be keen. Following Celtic’s earliest elimination from the competition in 15 years, manager Neil Lennon some of his players were distracted by interest from other clubs. “Get your mentality right, get your attitude right,” he said. “If some of you don’t want to be here, leave. Let us work with players who want to be here.” Ouch.</td>\n",

       "      <td>EU withdrawal bill needs major rewrites, Lords committee says</td>\n",
       "      <td>The EU withdrawal bill is fundamentally flawed and needs to be rewritten in several ways, peers have said, as the House of Lords prepares to debate the legislation this week. The Lords constitution committee said that the bill as it currently stands risked “undermining legal certainty” and should be substantially changed, even though it has already been voted through the House of Commons. The bill will be subject to fierce debate when it reaches the Lords on Tuesday and Wednesday, with remain-supporting peers expected to vote for a motion of regret that the public is not getting another say over Brexit. Ahead of that battle, the committee recommended major changes that could be debated at a later stage of the bill’s passage through the second chamber. The purpose of the legislation is to transpose EU legislation into domestic law in time for Brexit day at the end of March 2019. But the committee said the task was complicated not only by its “scale and complexity”, but problems with the drafting. “We conclude that the bill risks fundamentally undermining legal certainty in a number of ways,” the cross-party group said. The peers said the method proposed to create a new category of “retained EU law” would cause “problematic uncertainties and ambiguities”. They also criticised the elements of the bill granting ministers power to amend regulations without full parliamentary scrutiny, known as Henry VIII powers, saying they are “overly broad” and there is an “unacceptably wide” emergency procedure for short-term changes. Thirdly, the peers warned that failure to secure agreement from the Scottish and Welsh administrations about the devolution of powers returned from Brussels could have “significant constitutional repercussions”. “The bill is therefore fundamentally flawed from a constitutional perspective in multiple ways,” the report said. Lady Taylor of Bolton, the chair of the committee, said: “We acknowledge the scale, challenge and unprecedented nature of the task of converting existing EU law into UK law, but as it stands, this bill is constitutionally unacceptable.” All the aspects of the bill criticised by the peers have already been challenged in the Commons, but ultimately, the government was only defeated on one issue, as MPs insisted they wanted a guaranteed vote on the terms of leaving before Brexit. Peers will have to decide how far they want to go towards challenging the bill when amendments are debated at committee and report stage in the coming weeks. Labour is planning to support around 20 amendments in the Lords, meaning there is a real chance of government defeats with the support of crossbench and Lib Dem peers. Top of its list of demands are: a role for parliament in the event of no deal; a vote for the UK parliament on the final deal ahead of the EU parliament; a time-limited transitional period on current terms; enhanced protection for EU-derived rights; further limitations on Henry VIII powers; and removing the government’s fixed Brexit day. Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the Lords, who will open the second reading debate for Labour said: “We will work with others around the Lords to change this bill so it becomes an enabling measure for, rather than an obstacle to a transitional period, as is currently the case. This will include seeking amendments relating to ‘exit day’, ensuring the government cannot reduce rights via secondary legislation, and providing greater clarity about the role of the European court of justice and the future status of its case law. “Labour has consistently called for a transitional period based on current terms, including a temporary extension to our participation in the single market and customs union. This would prevent a cliff edge for consumers and businesses in March 2019.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>There are now more Romanians living in the UK than there are Irish nationals or Indians, official figures reveal. Romania has overtaken the Republic of Ireland and India to move from fourth to second most-common non-British nationality in the UK, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) found. The number of Romanian nationals living in the UK in 2017 was estimated to be 411,000 – a jump of 25% on the previous year, and the largest increase for any country.\\nRomania joined the European Union in 2007 but it was only in 2014 that restrictions on Romanians’ rights to work in the UK were lifted. Polish remains the most common non-British nationality, with an estimated 1 million in the UK. The UK government has reached an agreement with the EU on citizens’ rights in negotiations on Britain’s withdrawal from the EU. People who, by 31 December 2020, have been continuously and “lawfully living” in the UK for five years will be able to apply to stay indefinitely by acquiring settled status. Those who will have been living here for less than five continuous years by that date will be able to apply to stay until they have reached that five-year threshold. Then they too can also apply for settled status. Nicola White, of the ONS migration statistics division, said: “Non-UK born and non-British populations continued to increase in 2017, as more people continued to come to the UK to live than move to live abroad for a year or more. “Poland-born residents and Polish nationals were the most common populations from outside the UK. However, the largest increases in population were seen from those born in Romania and those with Romanian nationality.”\\nAbout 350,000 Irish nationals lived in the UK in 2017, while there were 346,000 Indians. The figures show the total number of non-British nationals living in the UK in 2017 was 6.2 million, up 4% on 2016’s total of 6 million. This is a smaller rise than that recorded between 2015 and 2016, when the number rose by 8%. The figures show that 3.8 million (61%) of the 6.2 million non-British nationals living in the UK in 2017 held EU nationality. This is roughly the same proportion as 2016 (60%). London had the largest proportion of non-British nationals in 2017, with the highest numbers in the local authorities of Newham (38%), Westminster (36%) and Brent (34%). The ONS data is based on a survey of households and does not include most people living in communal establishments, some NHS accommodation, or students living in halls of residence who have non-UK resident parents.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Much of the global focus last weekend was diverted (perhaps mercifully) away from Trumpland and towards Cuba, where the one-time revolutionary Fidel Castro died aged 90. In this week’s Guardian Weekly our news pages examines what Castro’s passing means for Cuba’s thawing relations with the US and the rest of the world, a leader column considers his place in history, while on the Opinion pages Zoe Williams reminds us of the dangers of eulogising deceased dictators from either side of the political spectrum. That’s all inside the edition. Our cover story this week turns to environmental big thinking, and the quest to harness clean, limitless energy from nuclear fusion. The Guardian’s head of environment Damian Carrington reports from southern France and the site of a massive new internationally funded reactor complex, where it is hoped an ambition that has eluded atomic scientists for 60 years can be brought to fruition within the next few decades. We know Weekly readers care passionately about energy and the environment, so we look forward to hearing your thoughts on this one. Is fusion the answer to the world’s energy problems, or are renewables the way forward? Write to our Reply page and let us know! France was in the news for other matters this week, as the conservative François Fillon won the centre-right presidential primary election. Will the man they call the “French Thatcher” defeat the Front National’s Marine Le Pen in next year’s presidential election proper – and if so, what can France expect? In Syria, a rapid advance by pro-Assad forces appears to have struck a decisive blow in the battle for Aleppo. In northern Nigeria, the disruption of food production by Islamist extremists is threatening to cause a humanitarian disaster. From Pakistan, Le Monde reports on the growing presence and influence of Islamic State as it is squeezed out of its heartlands. Let’s not forget the US, of course, where Donald Trump’s apparent readiness to change his stance from one meeting to the next has left both supporters and opponents confused. From New York, David Smith attempts to make sense of it all. In the UK, allegations of child abuse focused on youth football coaching programmes stretching back decades are threatening to engulf the national game. We also catch up with chancellor Phillip Hammond’s autumn economic statement, and what it means for the country. The Weekly Review gets stuck into some exciting scientific efforts to apply nature’s intelligent design to modern medicine. From Montreal, we hear of an interesting scheme to limit suburban restaurants as a way of controlling gentrification. The Books pages review Zadie Smith’s new millennial coming-of-age novel, and also profile the bestselling Spanish-language author Corin Tellado, whose extensive body of romantic fiction reveals many insights into Spanish society. Culture meets Albania’s prime minister Edi Rama, a talented artist as well as a politician, and finds out why Newark, New Jersey, is becoming a leading destination in the jazz music world. We’re moving rapidly towards the Christmas holiday season here in the UK and so our attention is turning to the Guardian Weekly’s year-ending double edition, which will be with you later this month. I don’t want to give too much away at the moment, but I will say that we’re definitely going to need those extra pages … Thanks for reading and do let us know your thoughts on the edition.

       "      <td>Communities across the US are using federal stimulus money to bring grocery stores and healthy food to food deserts, as the pandemic and rising costs put nutrition further out of reach for many. The regions using American Rescue Plan funds include Montana’s Fort Belknap Indian Reservation, a 1,000-sq-mile expanse shared by the Assiniboine and Gros Ventre tribes. Most of the reservation is considered a food desert by the US Department of Agriculture, meaning most residents have little access to healthy food. An Indigenous-owned company on the reservation plans to renovate and expand the Little River Trading Post, formerly part of the Kwik Stop chain, in the town of Fort Belknap Agency.\\nThe combination gas station and convenience store closed briefly after it was bought and then reopened in December selling apples, bananas, potatoes, onions and berries. “Our berries fly off the shelves,” said Eddie Moore, a business development officer who runs the store for the Island Mountain Development Group, which bought the business last year. It plans to use federal stimulus funds to expand its fresh produce offering this year. At least five other communities have proposed using money from the American Rescue Plan – the $1.9tn package approved by Congress in 2021 to help the country recover from the pandemic’s effects – to open or revive grocery stores, according to the US Treasury Department. A slew of other areas are looking at ways the funds could ease food insecurity. In Toledo, Ohio, local activists have urged the city to use $1m of the federal infrastructure funds to help attract a grocery store to a low-income neighborhood. Healthier food would help alleviate high obesity, cholesterol and blood pressure problems among Toledo’s Black population, said the Rev Donald Perryman, president of the Toledo advocacy group United Pastors for Social Empowerment. “When you have been an oppressed resident of our country in some of these disadvantaged neighborhoods, you develop some habits related to survival,” he said. “Sometimes those habits become embedded.” Black and Latinos are more likely to live in areas without grocery stores than white people, as are low-income people. The grocery model is broken and the federal funding offers new ways to fix it, said Beverley Wheeler, director of DC Hunger Solutions, which runs nutrition programs in the nation’s capital. “Our large grocery stores have a business model that’s built on education and income,” said Wheeler, who noted Washington DC plans to use American Rescue Plan funds to add smaller grocery stores to underserved neighborhoods this year. “They don’t build them in the neighborhoods where we need them.” It can be hard for a grocery store to make a profit even in affluent communities, so getting companies to stick around low-income neighborhoods is a challenge, said Connie Max, executive vice-president for lending with the Local Initiatives Support Corp, a non-profit that helps fund community projects. More communities are asking for help attracting or retaining grocers, Max said, with local governments and community non-profits gathering funds rather than waiting for companies to open stores on their own. “The margins are pretty thin on grocery stores,” she said. “Whenever we can, we try to help them to purchase the facility to really root them in the community.” But giving residents access to healthy food may not be as simple as opening a new grocery store.\\nToledo officials are trying to figure out what would help the most, especially in neighborhoods that have lost population. Less than half the population gets its groceries from grocery stores, said Sandy Spang, the city’s deputy economic development director, down from 90% in 1988. The city is surveying residents to see whether new grocery stores would be more useful than, say, food trucks or other prepared food options. “I think we need to recognize the distribution of food is changing,” Spang said. “I don’t think we can look at the solutions of 40 years ago. If you’ve lost density in neighborhoods, you’re not necessarily going to have feasibility for traditional grocery stores.” In Birmingham, Alabama, which is also researching ways to use ARP funds for healthier food options, the city paid to renovate an abandoned grocery store but realized it would need to divide the building in half to attract a new grocer because companies tend to prefer smaller stores. Residents surrounded by convenience and dollar stores have sorely missed having access to fresh foods such as produce, baked goods and seafood, said Carol Clarke, the city councilor who represents the neighborhood. “It is most assuredly a food desert,” she said. Other communities are also using ARP funds to ease food insecurity: The Cherokee Nation hopes to open a grocery store in Marble City, Oklahoma. “It’s important to ensure our Cherokee communities inside the reservation have access to healthy foods, especially in our rural areas where there are limited resources including grocery stores,” said Chuck Hoskin Jr, Cherokee Nation principal chief. Austin, Texas, where 12 of the city’s zip codes lack grocery stores, plans to open at least one pilot store in underserved eastern Austin. Macon-Bibb county, Georgia, is spending $1m on a grocery store in a low-income neighborhood. Memphis, Tennessee, and Washington DC, also plan to open ARP-funded stores, and Charleston, West Virginia, has proposed Miss Ruby’s Corner Market, which would take over the site of a former soda fountain near a senior housing complex where residents have trouble getting to grocery stores further away. The non-profit store will carry local produce and offer nutrition education, said Spencer Moss, executive director of the West Virginia Food &amp; Farm Coalition, which is helping to open the business. “We don’t need to make a profit,” she said. “We just need to break even.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>In a world as complex as ours, slogans are more important than they have any right to be. When questions of how to organise society, distribute resources and conduct relations with our neighbours fox even the greatest of experts, it’s human nature to run for the shelter of an easy explanation. The shorthands we use to skip over messy realities – “budget responsibility”, “war on terror”, “migrant crisis” – shape our understanding of them, for good or ill. They are what linguist Geoffrey Leech once described as “concept forming”. That means that, in any contentious debate, getting in there early with a pithy phrase is half the battle.\\nWhen it comes to Brexit, the most intricate political problem Britain has faced for decades, it’s clear who’s been winning the war. “Take back control” was a stroke of genius, boiling down the problem of how to improve lives in an interdependent world to a simple question of self-determination. “No deal is better than a bad deal” was good too: despite the fact that leaving the EU without any kind of agreement represents the worst outcome of all, it recast the government’s weakness as defiance. And now we have the “Brexit dividend”, the fiscal bounty that leaving the world’s largest trading bloc will apparently deliver. It’s a phrase you’ll have read a lot in the past day or two. As “allies of the foreign secretary” briefed that he was to demand an extra £5bn for the NHS in cabinet this week, it kept cropping up – sometimes with and sometimes without inverted commas, depending on the level of scepticism applied. Johnson “will not relent on demands for a £100m a week Brexit dividend until it is secured”, wrote the Times. His Brexit brother-in-arms Liam Fox backed him up. “I think it’s very useful to remind people that we will get a dividend from leaving the EU,” he told the BBC. Maybe they were taking their cue from Jacob Rees-Mogg, who told the Sun on Sunday: “Brexit is a great opportunity for the UK to build a new independent trade policy that delivers jobs, cheaper food and clothing — an immediate Brexit dividend for the British people.”\\nPerhaps they’re ultimately inspired by “peace dividend”, a phrase first used in 1969 to describe the money that would no longer have to be spent on the Vietnam war if it were brought to an end, and used much more widely at the end of the cold war. In any case, it’s a clever formulation: it’s neat, catchy, and appears to sum up the possibilities of the post-Brexit era. The contribution the UK currently makes to the EU budget will soon be ours to spend however we see fit. But it’s a blatant lie. There is no “Brexit dividend”, because the net effect of Brexit is to cost the UK money. As the FT set out in excruciating detail before Christmas, leaving the EU doesn’t come cheap. Forget the “Brexit divorce settlement”, the forty-odd billion that covers existing budget commitments and some other costs such as pensions. We haven’t even left yet, but the uncertainty has already zapped 1.3% of GDP, according to estimates – the equivalent of £340m per week. And before you counter that this is still less than the fabled £350m a week that was plastered on campaign buses during the referendum, remember that that figure, too, was a lie. The rough cost per week of EU membership adds up to more like £136m – some of which funds regulatory agencies we benefit from and will have to replicate after we leave. So the phrase “Brexit dividend” should definitely come with flashing lights and sirens, and at the very least inverted commas. But I fear it’s too late. The concept already has currency, and may be unstoppable. It’s incumbent on those who see it for what it is to point this out at every opportunity, and perhaps come up with a reality-based version. Reality, in this case, may be too depressing, too unglamorous a rival. But at least “Brexit burden” or “Brexit penalty” have the ring of truth.</td>\n",

But because she is on the right side of history, she apparently fails to see that the choice of words that the Black Lives Matter movement uses to frame its funding requirement, ie “to improve black people’s lives in a racist society”, actually leaves those millions of people who were educated in the belief that empire was good with nowhere to go: if it is a racist society and I am not on the right side of history, then I am a racist. If we are to avoid our fellow citizens falling into the hands of rightwing extremists then, without detracting from the social justice imperative, we need to embrace a vocabulary and dialogue that is more nuanced and which gives people on the wrong side of history the opportunity to reflect on their cultural preconceptions and prejudices in a climate that is less febrile and accusatory. Christopher Coppock Cardiff • Nesrine Malik’s article reminds me of another occasion when the government launched a targeted attack on critics to obscure the impacts of its disastrous social policies. Back in the 1980s, the National Association of Citizens’ Advice Bureaux (NACAB) collected information from its local bureaux about a wide range of issues and published the data in the form of short briefing papers. The cumulative effect of these papers in the area of social security showed how cuts in benefits were generating hugely increased poverty among most population groups. Thatcher’s government argued that NACAB should not be engaging in politics, and threatened to withdraw NACAB’s core funding, which would have led to its closure. NACAB, supported by a wide-ranging protest, and with legal advice, resisted the threat, which was later ruled unlawful. Fortunately, Black Lives Matter UK does not rely on government funding, but civil society has to ensure that through it and other channels, the fight continues to resist the government’s attempt to obscure its increasingly racist policies, actions and threats.

       "      <td>‘Astonishing’ errands: Old Enough's Japanese creator on the child star TV hit</td>\n",
       "      <td>Three decades after it first aired on Japanese TV, international audiences are discovering why Old Enough, a show that makes stars of children as young as two, has enjoyed such enduring popularity. Described by the Guardian’s Stuart Heritage as “an absolute rollercoaster of emotions that leaves you in tatters”, the programme follows a simple, crowd-pleasing format. Children aged between two and five are sent out alone on their first errand by their nervous parents. As they negotiate roads and public transport, camera crew disguised as passersby capture every emotional portion of their journey, from the tearful frustration of getting lost to the elation of returning to their relieved parents, errand completed.\\nThe tasks set in the programme reflect errands Japanese children carry out in real life, although for every rural family happy to send their four-year-old to the corner shop is another in Tokyo that would shudder at the thought of exposing their offspring to the potential dangers of busy urban streets. In one episode, Hiroki, a two-year-old boy, navigates traffic on a 20-minute journey to the shop to buy flowers, curry and fishcakes for his mother. In another, Hinako, who is just shy of five, is tasked with giving a handmade hara-obi or traditional maternity belt to a pregnant neighbour before buying wakame, an edible seaweed, and picking onions and cabbage from the family allotment. During an errand to the local market, three-year-old Yuka buys udon noodles and tempura, but returns with sea bream instead of the prawns her mother had requested. All is quickly forgiven. The show’s creator, Junji Ouchi, says the show continues to draw in audiences because it centres on a treasured feature of Japanese family life. Still the programme’s executive director, he said he was inspired by the widely accepted practice among Japanese parents of asking their children to run errands alone. “I thought, what if we film a child when they’re sent on their very first errand, without them being aware of what we’re doing?” he says. “Perhaps we might find something in the footage that’s worthy of television. “Family situations have changed drastically over the 30-plus years since we started this … but the tradition of sending children on errands remains. Our hope is to document that tradition before it gradually disappears.” What viewers don’t see are the errands that don’t work out, although Ouchi says he prefers not to describe them as failures. “We started conducting simulations and learned that for every 10 errands we shoot, about one will be television material. To this day, we just focus on recording those first errand moments and one out of every six to 10 gets aired.” The Nippon TV series, a staple of Japanese television since it first aired as Hajimete no Otsukai or My First Errand in 1991, has acquired a cast of thousands of families. Its success in Japan, where it still attracts huge audiences, is proof that the warning to never work with children or animals may only be half right. The format has been untouched for 30 years, but each series captures subtle changes in Japanese society and family dynamics. Old Enough first appeared as Japan’s asset-inflated “bubble economy” was about to make way for decades of stagnation, and just as the country started to grapple with rural depopulation and the erosion of the traditional family unit, with several generations living under the same roof. “By filming the children on their first errands, we are documenting an aspect of contemporary Japan at any given point in time,” Ouchi says. “That is a major theme of the show, and we believe it is one of the reasons that throughout its long history, it has won the support of viewers across all generations. The children are the undisputed stars of the show, thanks both to their successes and their capacity for the unpredictable – a wrong turn, an impromptu conversation or an overly ponderous visit to the shops. “Even children we expect to come home quickly start doing something else that we find astonishing,” Ouchi says. “Sometimes their errand ends up taking quite a long time. “We’ve been doing this for decades, but there hasn’t been one errand that looked the same as any of the others. Perhaps that’s how we’ve managed to keep making the show for so long without viewers growing weary of it.” The international success of Old Enough has inevitably generated a debate about whether its premise would work in other countries, particularly in the west, where the world beyond the front door can seem fraught with danger. The third series of the Singapore-based version will be produced soon, and Nippon TV says it is considering many offers to make adaptations in other countries. Some social media users have questioned the ethics of sending toddlers out into the unknown, albeit tracked by camera crews and staff along the way. The show’s producer, Naoko Yano, says the families are willing participants in a documentary, not contestants in an exploitative TV reality show. “We select families that are planning to ask their child to run their first errand anyway, regardless of whether they will get filmed or not,” she says. “We try to find families who will allow us to record their stories. “It is the families that decide what errand they want their child to run. We don’t tell them what to do. We actually share stories of failures that happened throughout the years and offer advice on how to get their child to feel motivated about their task.” The producers’ relationship with the families continues long after their appearance, mainly via new year’s greetings cards and letters. Some write to share family milestones, when their child starts a new school or gets married.\\nOne viewer who had appeared on the show as a child even contacted the network to film their own child running an errand. Ouchi believes the benign version of tough love dispensed on Old Enough gives children too young to tie their shoelaces an opportunity to exhibit astonishing levels of autonomy and enterprise. “All we really want is for the child to have an amazing day full of memories they will cherish for the rest of their lives,” he says. “Sometimes adults have to play the bad guy to encourage a child to become independent. So, when grownups help a child out of kindness, could it be because they don’t see them as equals? We try to make sure the children don’t feel like they’re still being treated like babies.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Chelsea will not face punishment for what the club themselves described as antisemitic chanting by their fans at a Europa League game in Hungary after Uefa closed the disciplinary proceedings. There was no explanation from European football’s governing body, which had charged Chelsea with racist behaviour by supporters at December’s match against Vidi, but it is believed it reached the decision because it could not gather enough evidence.\\nAfter the Europa League game Chelsea publicly condemned a small section of their travelling support for an anti-Tottenham Hotspur chant which referenced “Yids”. They said the chant, heard in the opening three minutes of the game, “shamed the club” and they questioned “the brainpower” of those responsible. Chelsea faced a partial closure of Stamford Bridge in European competition if found guilty. A Uefa statement said: “The CEDB [control, ethics and disciplinary body] has decided to close the disciplinary proceedings against Chelsea FC.” Real Madrid’s Sergio Ramos has been suspended for an extra European match after Uefa found him guilty of “clearly receiving a yellow card on purpose” and will miss two games in total. Ramos was booked in the 89th minute of Madrid’s 2-1 win at Ajax. Immediately after the match he was quoted as saying he “would be lying” if he were to deny deliberately earning the caution, which meant he could serve a ban in the return leg of the last-16 tie and start with a clean disciplinary slate in any quarter-final. Later he used social media to claim he had not intentionally collected a yellow card but was referring to purposely giving away a free-kick to prevent an Ajax equaliser. Uefa has fined Manchester United €16,000 (£13,700) over the throwing of objects and blocked stairways in the Champions League game at home to Paris Saint-Germain.

       "      <td>As a poster child for the climate emergency, Miami Beach has become a world leader in mitigating the effects of sea-level rise. Now the subtropical Florida city is cutting back on its famous swaying palm trees as it seeks shadier alternatives to preserve its environment and try to keep residents and visitors cool.\\nOfficials have embarked on a 30-year plan to reduce the percentage of palm trees in the city to only one quarter of its total canopy by 2050, according to the Miami Herald. Currently, Arecaceae palms account for more than 55% of the city’s population of 48,900 trees. The cutback is needed, the newspaper says, to reduce urban warming and improve air quality, and about 1,000 palm trees will be removed in the coming weeks as part of already scheduled construction projects. But Elizabeth Wheaton, the environmental and sustainability director for Miami Beach, said there was no plan for any mass chopping down of palms, which have been a staple of postcards and travel brochures depicting Miami for generations. Instead, the percentage reduction will be largely achieved by planting about 1,300 new shade trees instead of palms over the next two decades, which she said would make the city “more walkable and pleasant.” “Expanding shade canopy will enhance the city’s brand and quality of life,” Wheaton wrote in an email to the Herald. “Palms will continue to be a focal point along the city’s roads, green spaces and parks.” According to the urban forestry master plan that forms part of Miami Beach’s Rising Above initiative to combat the climate crisis, about 17 percent of the city’s 15.2 sq-mile footprint has a tree canopy. The plan details the environmental benefits of planting shade trees, including species such as oak, ash, elm and sycamore, in place of palms. For example, a 16in trunk diameter live oak tree would remove 510lb of carbon dioxide, 20oz of harmful ozone, and intercept 725 gallons of rainfall per year. By contrast, a native sabal palmetto palm of the same dimensions would absorb only 2.7lb of carbon dioxide, 1.7oz of ozone and 81 gallons of rainfall. “Trees have been proven to be one of the most effective tools for mitigating the effects of climate change,” the plan, drawn up by urban and landscape experts in conjunction with the Florida forestry service, states. “Palms, while an iconic part of Miami Beach’s landscape, have moved from being an accent plant to a major component of the city’s urban forest. General guidelines for species diversity state that no family should make up more than 30% of a city’s tree population.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>All Gates Open by Rob Young and Irmin Schmidt review – in praise of the rock band Can</td>\n",
       "      <td>Can, the German rock band active between 1968 and 1979, have in many ways, through no fault of their own, become the ultimate chin-stroking outfit. Born from Europe’s ruins, boasting two former students of avant-garde composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, a free-jazz drummer who restricted himself to relentless grooves and two ethnically diverse singers, their collision of postwar high culture with 60s counterculture makes them prime egghead material. Yet they were remarkable. Improvisation was the source of their albums and their incendiary live performances, but they still retained an ear for melody and even a pop sensibility. In concert they could be intense and, ironically for a group now so beloved of fashionable music commentators, a good few early fans were downright “heavies”: bikers and stoners drawn to the Can lack of compromise. In their first six albums, the band managed to anticipate jazz-rock, punk and sampling, as well as drum’n’bass techno. Can’s reputation in the UK took off when they began to be namechecked by new wave musicians: Pete Shelley, John Lydon, Gary Numan, Ultravox, then later the Fall, the Jesus &amp; Mary Chain and Primal Scream. To my generation, this cast Can as a mythical band, whose improvised three-hour concerts have a trapped-in-amber feel, confined as they are to the lost 70s. Owning their own recording studio, they amassed hundreds, maybe thousands of hours of unreleased music. The astonishing early albums – the raw Monster Movie, the epic Tago Mago, or the blissful Future Days – were strong enough to support any myths we wanted to believe. Later, recordings did emerge from the vaults, but nothing quite equalled the originals, and due to record company neglect, no perfect, definitive recording of their in-concert prowess remains – just tantalising segments. In 1997 Can gave over their entire back catalogue for the album Sacrilege, allowing classic tracks to be radically remixed by drum’n’bass musicians. It is very hard to imagine many other bands of the 70s allowing their work to be similarly reformed – nor the motivation to embark on such a project. But the music of Can seems to offer something uniquely creative to each new generation of musicians and listeners. It is telling, 20 years on, how dated Sacrilege now sounds compared with the original albums. Rob Young’s All Gates Open might or might not be the definitive biography of this slippery and protean band. It is an admirable work of loving and careful research. Young handles facts efficiently and turns up gems such as a cracking 1971 letter from Stockhausen to the immigration department of Cologne, protesting the possible expulsion of Can’s Japanese vocalist, Damo Suzuki. For someone just discovering the band’s music, All Gates Open has a superb narrative arc, especially when dealing with their formation, background and the creation of those great early albums. For Can trainspotters like me, there is not enough new material: where are the specific tour details and dates, an analysis of the mythical Can recording archives, fleshed out lives of the Can members while the band was active? Sometimes the eccentric, unique personalities of the band members get lost in the march of events and album chronology. A single page can reference Goethe, Roman emperor Carus, Alexander von Humbold, Schopenhauer, Beethoven and Schubert. This is justified as a serious and successful attempt to position Can in the cultural context they deserve to be situated in. But again we often feel we are getting away from the quotidian facts, from the grit of what it was actually like on tour with Can in 1972. The book is enhanced by the inclusion of an appendix of writings curated by Can’s keyboard player Irmin Schmidt and includes some of his personal journals. In many ways this anthology of reflections and dialogues on art, on Can and on life, is a more revealing endeavour than traditional rock biography, with all its demands and limitations. The only surviving German member of the band, Schmidt is a European intellectual with a love for all the arts; but he is also a mischievous iconoclast. His exchanges with figures as diverse as Wim Wenders, Mark E Smith and John Malkovich make for fascinating and thoughtful reading. The Can story continues because their music lives – and those albums will still sound as great to our children. • Alan Warner’s Can’s Tago Mago is published by Bloomsbury.

       "      <td>It was supposed to be the game of the century. The Golden State Warriors were aiming for the best win-loss record in NBA history. Meanwhile, the San Antonio Spurs had a 13-game winning streak and were on pace to put up the best point differential the league has ever seen. Monday’s game was hyped as a must-watch event: the Warriors’ unstoppable offense against the Spurs’ impossible defense. Well, the Warriors promptly solved that impossible defense, and basketball fans were treated to yet another Warriors blowout. Golden State demolished San Antonio 120-90. There was very little the Spurs could do. Putting Kawhi Leonard, the reigning defensive player of the year, on Steph Curry only briefly slowed him down. Curry scored 37 points in the game, despite sitting for the entire fourth quarter.\\nEven for those who have enjoyed watching the Warriors embarrass opposing teams, Monday’s game was a disappointment. There was no drama, no suspense, no intrigue. Fans were promised a historic clash. Instead, they witnessed the basketball version of the NFC championship game between the Panthers and the Cardinals. (Curry was playing playing the role of Cam Newton, obviously.) Now, this was only one game, and it may end up being just an aberration. The Spurs were playing at Oracle Arena, where the Warriors have yet to lose all season, and without Tim Duncan, who sat out with knee soreness. Although his days as a MVP candidate are firmly in the past, Duncan’s presence would have made a difference, albeit probably not a 30- point one. The two teams next play on 19 March, in San Antonio, with the Spurs potentially at full strength. If the Spurs pull off victory there, or even suffer a close loss, we’ll all go back daydreaming about a seven-game Western Conference finals between the two. But maybe that is wishful thinking. It’s also possible that these Warriors have no rival and will continue to decimate the NBA like an invasive species without a natural predator. This was the second time in two weeks that the Warriors embarrassed one of the teams that supposedly had a shot at knocking them out of the playoffs. Last week, they took on the Cavaliers in what was supposed to be an NBA finals preview. That turned out to be a 34-point road win for the Warriors. That loss spurred a coaching change and questions about whether Cleveland’s LeBron James-Kyrie Irving-Kevin Love super-team was doomed by the Warriors’ mere existence. It’s to the point where the NBA might have a Superman problem on its hands. As many attempted movie adaptations will attest, it’s notoriously difficult to develop engaging stories about Superman, a character so powerful he can do just about anything. It’s difficult to come up with believable scenarios for Superman where there’s any drama or provide him with opponents that represent any realistic danger. Greatness, no matter how impressive, can end up being boring without legitimate conflict. We’re not at that point with the Warriors yet, but Monday night’s win suggests that this rest of this season could end up completely lacking suspense – unless a team figures out what their Kryptonite could be. Video of the week\\nThe Phoenix Suns and the Atlanta Hawks couldn’t duplicate this series of ridiculous offensive mistakes if they spent weeks practicing choreography. It’s almost annoying when Kent Bazemore finally makes a shot. How did LeBron carry the Cavaliers this week? I’m not sure if “carried” is right term for this, but the events of the last week certainly have revealed exactly how much weight LeBron James holds within the organization. It’s widely believed that James was instrumental in his team’s decision to replace head coach David Blatt with assistant Tyronn Lue on Friday. Publicly, James had said he was surprised by Blatt’s firing, and maybe he didn’t directly request the change, but nobody believes the team would have make such a drastic move if James were against it. Judging by the reports that followed the announcement, the only real surprise that James could have is in the fact that Blatt lasted as long as he did. Quote of the week If David Blatt’s getting fired, how in the hell do the rest of us have jobs? Because our front offices aren’t quite as crazy as theirs. – Detroit Pistons head coach Stan Van Gundy on Blatt’s firing. The Notorious SVG has a point. Under Blatt, the Cavaliers had a 30-11 record and was comfortably at the top of the Eastern Conference standings. Most franchises wouldn’t make a change under these circumstances, but most franchises aren’t run by Dan Gilbert. Of course, Van Gundy, of all people, should realize that basketball teams have no shame when it comes to firing head coaches to placate a superstar player.\\nPower rankings 1. Golden State Warriors (Last week: 1) It’s not entirely the case that the Warriors don’t have a true rival, it’s just that the team they’re playing against hasn’t existed for nearly 20 years. With their Monday night win, the Warriors improved their record to 41-4, tying the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls for the best start in NBA history. At this point of the season, 72-10 seems like a very possible goal. 2. San Antonio Spurs (2) Before Monday’s loss to the Warriors, there was an argument that the Spurs were actually the best team in the NBA despite their less impressive record. Now? Now it would be easier to defend BoB’s claim that the earth is flat. 3. Oklahoma City Thunder (4) The Thunder had a seven-game win streak going until they lost a blizzard-delayed game against the Nets on Sunday. Maybe the Nets should only play on snow days from here on out. 4. Cleveland Cavaliers (3) Another ripple effect from the Blatt firing? LeBron James is now almost as hated in Israel, where Blatt coached Maccabi Tel Aviv, as he was in Ohio after The Decision. 5. Los Angeles Clippers (5) First, the Clippers steal the Pistons’ move of letting Josh Smith go for nothing. Then comes the news that Blake Griffin will miss significant amount of time after injuring his hand in an “undisclosed team-related incident.” Later rumors emerge that this incident was a fistfight with a member of the equipment staff that began in a restaurant. Other than all that, things have been quiet on the Clipper front. 6. Toronto Raptors (6) Congratulations Toronto, you’re currently in the weird, nebulous position that is “second best in the Eastern Conference.” Don’t get comfortable: some other team will take your place within the week, if not days. Also, congratulations to Kyle Lowry for rightfully getting voted in as an All-Star Game starter. That’s a much less tenuous achievement. 7. Chicago Bulls (7) Normally, when a team goes through a coaching change, a team is motivated to make sure their next game is a big win. The Bulls would have none of it, solidly beating the Cavaliers on their home floor in the first game of the post-Blatt era, causing their own fans to turn against them. 8. Atlanta Hawks (10) Remember last year, when nearly the entire Hawks’ starting lineup went to the All-Star Game? This year, there’s a good chance Paul Millsap will be their lone representative when the reserves are announced on Thursday. 9. Dallas Mavericks (9) Speaking of the All-Star Game, did you know that Zaza Pachulia was almost voted in as a starter? It’s true, thanks to the efforts of the entire country of Georgia, a Fugee and a Vine celebrity. Also: did you know that Vine celebrities can influence popular voting now and that this is absolutely terrifying on a wide variety of levels? 10. Memphis Grizzlies (8) Grizzlies GM Chris Wallace says he won’t be “compelled” to make a move before the trade deadline. Translation: he knows they have no shot of beating the Warriors, Spurs or the Thunder in the playoffs. 11. Houston Rockets (14) The Rockets, breaking new ground in their mission to make basketball as painful to watch as possible, intentionally fouled Andre Drummond 21 times during a loss to the Detroit Pistons. 12. Miami Heat (11) “Hey, Mr Riley, this is Ray Allen’s lawyer. If you continue to call my client, we will have no other option but to take out that restraining order we’ve talked about.” 13. Detroit Pistons (13) The Spurs’ loss on Monday means that, improbably, the Pistons remain the last team to beat the Warriors. 14. Boston Celtics (16) Anonymous, confidential message to Danny Ainge: “Give Avery Bradley anything and everything he wants, my heart cannot take him leaving. Sincerely, HF.” 15. Indiana Pacers (12) The Pacers lost to the Warriors by a mere 12 points last Friday, which clearly means they’re objectively a better team than both the Spurs and the Cavaliers. 16. Charlotte Hornets (21) Kemba Walker won Eastern Conference player of the week honors and has a small but non-zero chance of making the All-Star Game. All of this is confusing. 17. Sacramento Kings (22) While the Warriors and Spurs were playing what was supposed to be the game of the century, the Kings’ DeMarcus Cousins was busy scoring 56 points against the Hornets. The Hornets still won. 18. New York Knicks (15) In a 97-84 loss to the Hornets, Jeremy Lin scored 26 points against his old team, which served as a reminder of the golden age of Linsanity, back when the Guardian had an entire tag devoted to him. 19.

       "      <td>Israeli police officer jailed over 2014 death of Palestinian teenager</td>\n",
       "      <td>An Israeli border police officer who fatally shot a Palestinian teenager at a demonstration while the boy was posing no threat to soldiers has been sentenced to nine months in prison after a protracted court process. The father of 17-year-old Nadeem Nawara, whose case was covered by the Guardian and other international media four years ago, described the sentence for causing death by negligence as “ridiculous” and claimed that the officer, Ben Deri, had murdered his son. Deri’s plea bargain was held up by the teenager’s family and others in comparison to the long prison sentences typically handed down by the courts to Palestinians found guilty of killing Israelis. Nadeem was one of three Palestinian teenagers shot with live ammunition over a period of over an hour during a stone-throwing demonstration near Ofer prison on 15 May 2014, the day each year when Palestinians mark the Nakba, or “catastrophe”, the war around the time of the creation of Israel in 1948. Mohammad Salameh, 16, was fatally shot an hour after Nawara, and Mohamed al-Azi, who was 15 at the time, survived a gunshot wound to the chest. At the time an Israeli military spokesman tried to deflect outrage over the shootings, claiming footage had been edited to present an unfair picture of events.\\nThe sentence on Wednesday comes as Israeli security forces’ use of live fire is again in the spotlight after the fatal shooting of several dozen Palestinians at the Gaza border fence in recent weeks Deri was tried only for firing the fatal shots that killed Nadeem, as only the teenager’s family allowed for the body to be exhumed and an autopsy to be carried out. The examination found Nadeem had been killed by an Israeli M16 roundto the chest. The prosecution demonstrated in court that police and soldiers at the scene had been ordered only to use rubber-coated steel pellets, and that Deri had replaced the magazine on his M16 with one containing live rounds. At 1.45pm, four minutes after Nadeem threw a stone at Israeli forces, Deri shot him in the chest. Video footage seen by the Guardian at the time and taken from a nearby security camera showed that Nadeem was 80-200 metres from the soldiers when he was shot. The court agreed to a plea bargain which dropped a charge of manslaughter, describing Deri’s actions as having involving a “high degree of negligence” when he loaded his weapon with live bullets. Deri was ordered to pay the victim’s family $14,000 (£10,000). “This is not how justice is done,” said Nadeem’s father, Siam Nawara, after the sentencing. “I never expected the Israeli court to do justice for my martyred son, but I had to do all I can to present a solid case and to expose the Israeli judicial system before the world and I did.” He added: “Ben Deri who murders – and I am convinced that he intentionally committed murder – gets nine months and in the height of chutzpah I hear that they are considering appealing the severity of the sentence. “We are dealing with an entire system that discriminates on the basis of race and arrives at decisions that are far from just.” The case leaves multiple questions unanswered, including whether it was Deri or or others who fired the other live rounds. The court accepted that Deri had made two weapons handling errors that led him to fire the round that killed Nadeem. The method used by Israeli border police to fire large rubber bullets from an M16 rifle requires the use of a long barrel extension preventing live rounds being fired through it. The rubber bullet is placed in the extension and blank cartridges are loaded into the gun itself, with the force of the explosion from the blanks propelling the projectile. “The defendant did not check that his magazine contained only blanks and did not load a rubber bullet into the [barrel extension] as required. These two oversights, which amount to gross negligence, caused the death of the deceased,” the court judgment said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>‘Historic moment’ in Canada as Ontario strikes deal for $10-a-day childcare</td>\n",
       "      <td>Canada’s most populous province has signed a long-awaited deal with the federal government for subsidized childcare, paving the way for a nationwide plan that Justin Trudeau hailed as a “historic moment”. Unveiling the plan on Monday, the prime minister pledged that fees will eventually drop to C$10 a day by 2026, but experts caution that the plan must reckon with the reality of chronic staff shortages, fierce demand for limited spaces and murky funding agreements. Trudeau and Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, announced billions in funding for the province, part of a broader multibillion-dollar package offered to all provinces and territories. “Childcare is becoming a reality for all Canadians,” said Trudeau. Ford, who had held out for nearly a year for more money from Ottawa, is the last leader to sign on to the national childcare plan.\\nBut Monday’s announcement is essentially the amount of money offered to Ontario last year. “It’s unfortunate that it took this long, because the longer it takes to make the agreements, the longer it’s going to take to implement,” said Sarah Kaplan, director of the Institute for Gender and the Economy at the University of Toronto. “Families in Ontario have been missing out on the progress that could have been made.” Ontario has the highest childcare costs in the country; in Toronto families often pay more than C$1,600 a month for childcare. The new deal would, on average, cut fees in half by the end of 2022. Other provinces that signed agreements earlier have seen fees drop sharply. But Kaplan and others worry the early figures from deals announced by other provinces suggest they are not yet on track to reach their goal by 2026. “Unless something changes, you’ll still see low-income families paying upwards of 40% of their income, for childcare. That is not ‘affordable’,” she said. Additionally, Canada is struggling to train, hire and retain early childhood educators, many of whom are leaving the field amid frustrations over low pay. Without enough staff in childcare centres, families will be left waiting for space, or pushed to higher-cost options. For decades, a nationwide affordable childcare system has proven elusive for the governing Liberals. A previous attempt to introduce such a scheme was scuttled by an election defeat in 2006, but Canada’s decentralized governance system, in which provinces hold immense power, has also been blamed for hampering the rollout of a national plan. “At the end of the day, the federal government’s hands are tied and families are beholden to what provinces choose to do and if they are really going to take childcare seriously,” said Kaplan. Quebec implemented low-cost childcare in 1997 and economists say the province demonstrated the costs were easily recovered by a sharp increase in workforce participation, especially among women. When she announced the aim of nationwide affordable childcare last year, deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland pointed to the effects the coronavirus pandemic was having on women in the workforce. “Covid has brutally exposed something women have long known: without childcare, parents – usually mothers – can’t work,” she said, calling it an “investment worth making”.\\nAffordable childcare has become an important progressive issue during the pandemic, and in the United States, Joe Biden has tried – and failed – to include similar efforts in his administration’s proposed Build Back Better legislation. In both Canada and the US, there is a growing effort to recast childcare as both an investment in infrastructure, similar to roads and bridges, and as a ‘job creator’. “We told Minister Freeland, and all the other ministers involved, that were was a limited window of opportunity too, because the pandemic has opened people’s eyes to these issues. Luckily, they took it,” said Kaplan. “And Canada should be commended for making progress now. But honestly, this should have happened 20 years ago.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Trump firm's second Aberdeenshire golf course to get green light</td>\n",
       "      <td>Donald Trump’s family business is expected to win approval to build a second golf course on his Aberdeenshire estate, more than a decade after it was first promised. Local councillors are expected to rubberstamp the proposal on Tuesday after it was endorsed by Aberdeenshire’s planning officers, days before the council votes on a far more controversial bid by the Trump Organization to build 550 luxury homes nearby. The new 18-hole course, to be named MacLeod course after Trump’s mother Mary, will sit alongside the first loss-making championship course that opened at Menie north of Aberdeen in 2012. Trump has also owned the Turnberry golf resort in Ayrshire since 2014. Local community councillors believe the MacLeod course will benefit the area by boosting tourism, and help it recover from a slump caused by the collapse in oil prices, which hit Aberdeen’s North Sea oil and gas industries. But critics are doubtful about the course’s viability and believe it can only be funded by the construction and sale of the 550 luxury and holiday homes, which councillors will be voting on at a separate meeting on Thursday. The properties are expected to cost about £20m to build, with the largest one expected to sell for more than £1m each. The existing course and boutique hotel at MacLeod House have consistently lost money since they opened. Local people say the championship course, which closes for five months during the winter and is hit regularly by bad weather during the summer, is routinely empty.\\nThe latest accounts for the Trump International Golf Club Scotland show the business lost more than £1m in 2017 on a turnover of £2.5m, with the downturn cutting its income by 3% that year. Its survival is dependent on historic loans from President Trump totalling £40m and a top-up loan in 2017 of £1.3m from the DJT Holdings LLC, the parent company which also owns various other Trump Organization companies. But DJT Holdings LLC is under investigation by US prosecutors probing allegations Trump’s firms have profited from his presidency, although the inquiry is not thought to include his Aberdeenshire resort. The two golf courses were given outline planning permission in 2008 as part of Trump’s plans for a £750m golfing resort featuring an eight-storey five-star hotel, timeshare flats, conference centre, spa golfing academy, shops and sports facilities. None of those are expected to be built. That scheme floundered after the banking crisis, leaving critics of the scheme furious. The project involved the removal or remodelling of a large area of rare mobile dunes, which were legally protected as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). In June, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)announced it would strip the dunes of their SSSI designation. Among 15 conditions attached to the second golf course scheme, Aberdeenshire has told the Trump Organization it must have environment and habitat management plans for the site to protect its dunes, badgers and otters, and an outdoor access plan to protect public rights of way. David Wallace, the chairman of Belhelvie community council, which includes the nearby village of Balmedie,expressed concerns about construction traffic clogging up local roads while the new course and housing were under construction. The resort had originally been due to have a new road and junction, which was not being built. The council have significant reservations about the housing scheme but supported the new course. “We quite enjoy the fact we have such a prestigious golf course on our doorstep. It does bring people to the area but it is an expensive place to play,” Wallace said. The application for the second course was first submitted to Aberdeenshire council in September 2015 and appeared to lapse for several years. No new documents were submitted between August 2017 until earlier this year, seven months after the Trump Organization put forward its plans for the 550 houses in July 2018. David Milne, a fierce critic of Trump who lives near the resort’s clubhouse, said it was clear the housing scheme was needed to fund the resort. “The money has to come from somewhere,” he said. “There are not enough people playing that golf course to make it viable, and there never will be.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionists have been given extra time to continue discussions aimed at restoring a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland secretary, James Brokenshire, announced on Monday night there was “further progress” made at the talks in Stormont. Brokenshire held back from his threat to impose a budget, which would signal a partial return to direct rule from London. Responding to the progress at the talks, the secretary of state said: “[The parties] are making certain additional requests of the UK government which we need to consider. In the light of this, I believe it is right to defer the assessment on whether to introduce legislation to parliament this week to enable an executive to be formed. The parties will recommence talks in the morning and I will reassess the position tomorrow night.” The extension in the deadline came hours after Theresa May said she preferred the restoration of devolution in Northern Ireland rather than direct rule from London.\\nA spokesman for May said the British and Irish governments would work with both parties to secure a deal that would bring back power-sharing government in Belfast. He said: “We are clear we don’t want to see a return to direct rule, we want a return of devolved government in Northern Ireland, so that local decisions can be made by local politicians. “James Brokenshire has been clear that the latest we can practically introduce legislation to enable the executive’s formation would be this week in order for it to be in time for a new executive to set a budget.” The spokesman said the Northern Ireland secretary would update parliament later in the week about the state of play. Ireland’s foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, arrived in Belfast on Monday in a bid to help the parties reach a deal, saying on Twitter that it was an important day for Northern Ireland.\\nEarlier on Monday, the DUP, which props up May’s government, urged the Brokenshire to impose a budget on the region. The DUP’s suggestion indicated that the party saw little chance of an 11th hour deal with Sinn Féin that would restore the power-sharing government. Brokenshire had warned that he would be forced to draw up a budget by the end of Monday in order fund regional government departments in Northern Ireland. Otherwise, the local ministries could run out of money. The DUP said: “Our position has not changed. We want to see an executive set up; we would have done it March and sorted these issues in tandem. Progress would only be made towards a deal when Sinn Féin drops its ’red-line demands’. Given Sinn Féin have dragged their feet over the last 10 months, the secretary of state should bring forward a budget to bring a measure of good government to Northern Ireland.” The party added that it was still in favour of devolution for Northern Ireland if a deal could be reached. Sinn Féin said a deal could only be secured on the grounds of equality for all. The party’s key demand in the talks, which the DUP has resisted, is for the introduction of an Irish language act. This would give the Gaelic language having an equal status in law to English throughout Northern Ireland. Former Stormont minister Conor Murphy said any deal had to be for all and not just the political leadership of unionism. He said: ”That requires an end to the DUP’s denial of rights citizens enjoy everywhere else on these islands: language rights, marriage rights and the right to a coroner’s court.” The smaller nationalist party, the Social Democratic and Labour party, has called for joint authority over Northern Ireland by London and Dublin in the absence of a power-sharing administration. This is unlikely given the influence the DUP exercises at Westminster in holding the balance of power in the House of Commons.</td>\n",

       "      <td>He might be the most popular solo pianist on earth at the moment but the Berlin-based “neo-classical” star Nils Frahm will be the first to admit that he’s not a classical pianist of any description. In this two-hour show there is little harmony or chordal development, scarcely any improvisation, and – with the exception of the jagged, nerve-wracking, Michael Nyman-ish piano solo Hammers – little virtuosity. What you get in spades, however, is texture – something that the classical conservatoires and jazz modules have always ignored. You can buy the sheet music for Frahm’s piano solos, but the notes that he rattles out on his panoply of keyboards are almost incidental. What’s important is the tone; the grain; the satisfying way in which each studio-crafted voicing plonks and zings and bounces around the auditorium. Frahm even jokes about these limitations. “People seem to like that track where I play one chord for seven minutes,” he deadpans. “If I presented that at some really good music school they’d tell me it’s not even a track. It’s not even an idea.” Indeed, placing Frahm in the “classical” racks is a category error. His methodology has always been that of a dance music producer: using hypnotic repetition, delayed climaxes, and the kind of mutating voicings you find in filtered disco. The irony is that, when he moves into actual rave music, playing from his latest album All Melody, it doesn’t really work, at least not in this sit-down venue. It’s technically impressive to see him loop beats and basslines in real time, leaping between two U-shaped banks of keyboards – including a harmonium, a toy piano, a Fender Rhodes, a Steinway grand, a homemade organ, a Roland synth and a heavily dampered upright piano – but the results are rather generic, like a preset voicing on a home organ. What works, however, are the piano solos. These are internalised raves; quiet riots; exercises in acoustic acid house that transport you to a higher plane while remaining oddly static.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>As our cities’ skylines spiral upwards, we have grown accustomed to increasingly bad street art. For self-preservation, we train our eyes to dull the slogans that cover the buildings that gentrification means many can no longer afford to enter, but the white words painted on a wall in Shoreditch, east London, will stay with me: “Sex with refugees is jasmine-scented and beautiful”. The words, which have now been painted over, stunned me. Artist Robert Montgomery says that the words were ripped from another piece of his. This reads: “The refugees are beautiful, they bring ancient music and desert sweets and jasmine-filled sex”, which he happily posted for us all to see. On Facebook he denied creating the Shoreditch graffiti. But either version of the sentiment shows ignorance over the words and social misconceptions about the current refugee crisis.\\nIt is with a deep bitterness that it has to be spelled out that neither love nor sex is the solution. My mother was born in Malaysia, and this language echoes the colonial narrative that makes me feel sick. Throughout history, women of colour have been presented as alluring and tantalisingly exotic. The repercussions of this are felt through porn, advertising and experiences that women of colour have while dating. This piece of art mirrors that. The choice of language presents sex with another human as essentially different, foreign or fetish. This is not a great basis for relationships nor a way to bring about racial equality. As Jinan Petra, a campaigner against immigration detention, tells me: “To write such racist, orientalist, harmful bullshit about people who have been through so much – including sexual violence – in migration ... there are very few words. I’m a Syrian woman and in my professional and personal life I know that these views exist; the sentiment and the entitlement don’t surprise me.”\\nFrom my own work with female refugees, I am painfully aware of the sexual violence that vulnerable people face. While preparing to teach film-making to young asylum seekers and undocumented youth, we were faced with the grim reality that assault and rape were common. Not only is the journey notoriously perilous, the dangers don’t stop when you arrive in Britain. Without secure status, you are at the whim of those around you. For some, this has meant staying in abusive “romantic” relationships, while others have faced sexual violence from guards inside detention facilities. Even if you do happen to be in a loving relationship, Theresa May’s “hostile environment” can make it difficult. One evening, as the sun set, I awkwardly looked away as a man told his wife he loved her inside Yarl’s Wood immigration detention centre. “Don’t touch her,” a guard barked. They dropped their hands, wondering if this is what intimacy meant now. All the love in the world means nothing without money for a visa. While the Shoreditch “artwork” is disappointing, its obliviousness comes as no surprise. In British schools, we are not taught the true legacies of colonialism nor how people’s livelihoods have been damaged by our warfare. This accounts for people’s shock over the treatment of migrants in Libya. Often, the charity campaigns surrounding the refugee crisis are no better. Take the Save the Children advert that attempted to garner sympathy through the narrative of a white young girl, asking what if this happened in Europe. It ignored and erased the historical reasons as to why this is not happening here.\\nSimilarly, statements such as “refugees are welcome” is a powerful rallying cry but ignores that the UK has one of the biggest and most cruel detention facilities in Europe. Refugees can be held indefinitely. This is how our government “secures” our borders; it isn’t something we can shag away. From the perspective of Aleksandra Bilic, a film-maker who came to this country as a child refugee herself: “It is hard to realise that problems cannot be solved without confronting the greater factors at play and that these issues are beyond ourselves. But this is not a topic for artists to literally fuck with, as these are real issues. If you are going to speak on them, you should try and understand them.” This isn’t to say artists shouldn’t tackle political causes in their work. We need political art with teeth. But our talk of politics comes at a high cost. We have a responsibility to do our research, know the context that our work operates in and be genuinely informed about the cause we seek to amplify. If you do, it’ll prevent wasting time painting over shallow and harmful statements that nobody asked to see. • Jade Jackman is a documentary film-maker and writer based in London</td>\n",

       "      <td>Tens of thousands of people, many of them children skipping school, braved heavy rain to join a climate strike headed by Greta Thunberg in Bristol city centre. The vast crowd fell silent as the 17-year-old activist told them governments were acting like children and so it fell to young people to be “the adults in the room”. Police said there were more than 15,000 people at the Bristol Youth Strike 4 Climate event, while Thunberg estimated the figure as at least 30,000. As Thunberg spoke, onlookers clambered on to bus shelters and up trees and hung out of windows to catch a glimpse. Criticising governments and the media, she said: “Once again they sweep their mess under the rug for us – young people, their children – to clean up for them. We must continue and we have to be patient. Remember that the changes required will not happen overnight.” Thunberg arrived in Bristol by train and was driven to the climate strike in a red Nissan Leaf electric car. Wearing a yellow raincoat and woolly hat – a look copied by some of her devotees – she took to the stage to chants of “Greta, Greta” from schoolchildren and teenagers.\\nShe told them: “We will not be silenced because we are the change, and change is coming whether you like it or not. This emergency is being completely ignored by the politicians, the media and those in power. “Basically, nothing is being done to halt this crisis despite all the beautiful words and promises from our elected officials. So what did you do during this crucial time? I will not be silenced when the world is on fire.” Thunberg flagged up the recent decision by north Somerset council to oppose Bristol airport expansion as an example of what could be achieved if activists worked together. The Swedish teenager went on to join protesters on a march through the city centre accompanied by a samba band. She waved at well-wishers and at one point consoled a child who was clearly overwhelmed by the experience. Avon and Somerset police had warned of the potential for protesters to be hurt and urged parents not to allow children to go unaccompanied. Bristol Cathedral, which sits on College Green, was ready to open its doors to anyone needing refuge but the organisers insisted they had put enough measures in place to make sure nobody was hurt.\\nThe poor weather did not dampen enthusiasm. Alison Thomson, who brought along her 10-year-old daughter, Emily, said: “I thought she might be a bit young but she said this would be her only chance to see [Thunberg] speak so I agreed.” Emily said: “I think it’s really important that people understand what is happening to the Earth.” She was returning to school after the event to give a presentation on climate change.\\nIsaac and Maya Swann, 11 and 15, had persuaded their mother, Karen Davies, to bring them along. Maya said: “We want to help make a change. Greta’s really brave and inspirational, giving up part of her childhood to spread this message. It was cold and wet but it is was worth it. It was exciting to see how many people care.” Davies said: “I was against them taking time off school but last night they came to me and said they felt if I was their age I would be there. They were right. I’d be in the thick of it. I sent an email to the school and they were supportive. I think many schools see it as educational. It was a lovely experience … It’s good to see that so many people can be inspired by one girl.”\\nHannah Burge, 12, and Harvey Hennessy, 16, have organised school strikes in Barnstaple, north Devon. Their biggest turnout has been 850. “It’s been amazing seeing so many people here,” said Hannah. “Greta is such a role model for us.” Mya-Rose Craig, 17, an ornithologist who recently became the youngest person in the UK to be awarded an honorary doctorate, said: “It’s so cool to see so many thousands of young people here ready to fight for our future.” Ed Thompson, a housemaster at Clifton college, took overseas boarders aged 11-13 and the school’s “green team” to the event. He said: “We have discussed Greta’s influence in school, and she is a true icon to all ages for her passion, determination, tenacity and likability. The word ‘inspiration’ is too often used, but she is a guiding light to the next generation for peaceful but powerful activism, and encouraging love and care for our environment, which is such a strong message for young people.”\\nThe crowd was swollen by many students who were missing lectures, tutorials and lab sessions. But it was not just young people who attended. There were groups of doctors, nurses and even a collective of wildlife film-makers. One moment of tension came when police equipped with video cameras moved through the crowd pointing their lenses at strikers, including a group from the Public and Commercial Services Union. Some employers had turned a blind eye to workers taking time to attend. Good Energy, a green energy company from Chippenham in Wiltshire, went further by actively telling its 250-strong workforce to join the strike. The mayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees, tweeted:\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Authorities issued an emergency warning for an uncontrolled bushfire which threatening lives and homes in Bullsbrook, northeast of Perth on Thursday afternoon. Meanwhile, a “watch and act” alert was issued for a bush blaze near St Marys on Tasmania’s east coast where residents were being urged to enact bushfire plans. It came as heatwave conditions began to hit large swathes of Australia’s eastern and southern coasts, bringing high fire danger to the bushfire-ravaged states of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. While both fires in Perth and Tasmania were downgraded on Thursday evening, the Bullsbrook fire northeast of Perth remains out of control despite conditions easing slightly. The blaze is now at “watch and act” level, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services says. The bushfire about 1.5km west of the St Marys township in Tasmania was brought under control on Thursday evening but severe fire danger will persist on the east coast, southeast and central regions on Friday. As dozens of fires continued to burn across the country, the Bureau of Meteorology forecast a top of 39C in Melbourne on Thursday, while people in Adelaide (42C) and Canberra (37C) were also set to swelter. The NSW government also announced an inquiry into the unprecedented bushfire crisis, which the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, pledged would “leave no stone unturned”. Three firefighters were injured, while another has escaped unharmed, after a tree fell on to their truck in the Australian Capital Territory. The crew were working to slow the spread of the 15,000-hectare Orroral Valley fire on Wednesday night when the tree crashed on to the tanker.\\nThree of them suffered non-life threatening injuries. All four crew members were taken by ambulance to the Canberra hospital for assessment. Authorities in Victoria are continuing to open roads in fire-affected communities that had been isolated in the aftermath of devastating fires at the start of the month. After confirming about 250 people had been able to return to Mallacoota, the Victorian emergency management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, warned of the weather ahead. “Thursday will be warm, but Friday is a significant day for us with elevated fire conditions,” he said. “There’ll be storms that come through with the potential for dry lightning, so again it’s a challenging day for us.”\\nIn Canberra, where a massive bushfire south-west of the city came dangerously close to homes, authorities used improved conditions on Wednesday to prepare for what was forecast to be four days of sustained dry heat. The temperature was expected to hit 42C by Saturday, before a storm front comes through the city on Sunday. The ACT’s emergency services commissioner, Georgeina Whelan, said authorities hoped backburning operations would slow the spread of the 10,000ha Orroral Valley fire. Smoke from the blaze, which was described as most serious the capital has faced since the deadly 2003 bushfires, was expected to linger over the capital on Thursday morning. The fire is believed to have been started by a defence helicopter’s landing light after it landed in Namadgi national park while on a reconnaissance mission. The ACT’s Emergency Services Agency said a southerly wind change would push smoke from the blaze into the city centre. “ There was a “very high” fire danger rating in place for the ACT on Thursday, with temperatures forecast to reach as high as 38C. Meanwhile, the NSW Rural Fire Service said very high and severe fire danger was forecast for parts of state over the coming days, particularly in the south-east. Sydneysiders will be spared the worst of the heatwave, with a top of 29C on Thursday, steadily rising to 34C on Saturday. But across the fire-ravaged south coast, the bureau of forecast a top of 43C in Bega and 39C in Bermagui. In South Australia, authorities have declared severe bushfire conditions in six districts, with a total fire ban in place on Thursday for lower Eyre Peninsula, the mid-north, the Mount Lofty Ranges, Yorke Peninsula, the lower south-east and on Kangaroo Island. On Kangaroo Island, which has been devastated by fire, earthmoving equipment, water tankers and extra fire crews have been sent to strategic locations amid fears that hot spots across the existing fire ground could flare.\\nThe blaze – which has burnt through more than 210,000ha – is officially contained but the Country Fire Service has said crews were still finding hotspots in various areas including Blue Gum Hill, Cygnet River and Vivonne Bay. While the mercury was expected 42C on Thursday in Adelaide, it was predicted to soar beyond that in some regional centres, with Cummins, on Eyre Peninsula, among the hottest with a forecast high of 46C. But the heat and high-risk conditions will be relatively short-lived, with storms moving across the state on Friday before heavier rain at the weekend. with Australian Associated Press</td>\n",

       "      <td>Good morning. It’s the little things, isn’t it? The disrespect shown towards security and cleaning staff; the wine on the walls; the Downing Street staffer getting so drunk they were sick; two others having a fight; the senior civil servant who texted “we seem to have got away with it”. Sue Gray’s report has not dislodged the prime minister. But it has created an indelible image of the culture he oversaw, and the sense of tacit sanction under which his staff were operating. Jessica Elgot reports that MPs keeping count believe three more letters of no confidence in the prime minister have gone in – but yesterday was also a victory of sorts for Boris Johnson, who emerged wounded but still in place. One Tory MP tells the FT (£) today: “Most of us are resigned to the fact that he won’t be going but that we’ve lost the next general election.” That assessment reflects the larger problem – the fact that Johnson’s purpose as prime minister has narrowed to his own survival, and the way the rest of the political agenda has been co-opted to that end. Alcohol has been consumed, we read; so has Downing Street. Today’s newsletter, with Guardian columnist Rafael Behr, is about how the tail started to wag the big dog, and what that means for how the government operates. That’s right after the headlines. Five big stories Texas shooting | The gunman who killed 21 people in Uvalde signalled his intentions in a Facebook message a few minutes before beginning his attack. Cost of living | Rishi Sunak is expected to set out plans for a controversial windfall tax on energy companies on Thursday, as he proposes measures to ease the pain of rising household bills. Parliament | Sexual abuse, harassment and bullying accusations made against MPs are treated as “mere gossip”, dozens of Conservative staffers have said, in a letter urging Boris Johnson and party HQ to do more to tackle the problem. Medicine | NHS surgeons have successfully performed the world’s first double hand transplant for scleroderma, an autoimmune disease. Steven Gallagher, the recipient, said the operation had given him “a new lease of life”. US | Supermodel Kate Moss testified in the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard defamation trial. Moss said that the rumour that Depp pushed her down a flight of stairs when they were in a relationship was untrue. In depth: ‘Johnson will always act in the interests of whoever he’s most afraid of’\\nAt the end of his statement to the House of Commons yesterday, Boris Johnson tried to draw a line under Sue Gray’s investigation by emphasising his priorities for the future. “I hope very much that now she has reported we will be able to move on and focus on the priorities of the British people,” he said. “That is my mission, that is our mission, that is the mission of the whole of the government, and we will work day and night to deliver it.” It’s a noble sentiment – but one which recent events appear to fatally undermine. Here are some of the ways Johnson’s government appears to have reoriented its mission from the good of the country to the good of the prime minister. *** Big announcements are emerging with suspiciously good timing After weeks of delay and disagreement, a package of measures to help with the cost of living will finally be announced today – and if Rishi Sunak’s embrace of the near-mythological windfall tax helps to turn the page on the Sue Gray fallout, so much the better. The day after Johnson became the first serving prime minister to have been found to have broken the law while in office, the government’s controversial plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda to be processed was all over the front pages. And if Volodymyr Zelenskiy wants to know when he’s going to get a phone call from the British prime minister, all he has to do is set a Google alert for “new Partygate revelations”. Governments always time their announcements for maximum political impact, and dead cats can be so overrated as a theory of politics as to edge into conspiracy. But there is now a sense that governing priorities are being specifically tailored to minimise the harm of the Partygate story to the prime minister, instead of to the benefit of the government and the country as a whole. “I’m generally wary of that sort of thinking,” said Rafael Behr. “But with this lot – one former cabinet office official said to me, if you are ever in doubt about the motives for anything they’re doing, imagine the most cynical, short-termist reason you can think of, and there’s your answer. [Boris’s] entire career has been about getting out of scrapes, and that means there won’t be any sustained thinking behind anything.” *** The people in the background “The entire senior management has changed,” Boris Johnson said yesterday, doughtily ignoring the hecklers who pointed out that actually, one quite important part of the senior management had stayed the same. Nonetheless, it’s true that he has a new chief of staff, a new director of communications, and a new parliamentary private secretary. The question is whether we should be persuaded that this is really about instituting a new working culture – or firming up the prime minister’s grip on power. The most controversial new appointment is one Johnson didn’t mention in the House of Commons: the installation of David Canzini, an acolyte of his previous election guru Sir Lynton Crosby, as deputy chief of staff. Canzini “has a very similar ethos to Dominic Cummings”, said Rafael. His idea, inherited from Crosby, of getting “the barnacles off the boat” and focusing on the most broadly appealing policies, is “a campaign ethos, not a governing ethos”. Canzini has set about instituting “dividing line” policies which are driving the government further to the right. He is said to have been an enthusiastic advocate for the Rwanda policy, and responsible for the government’s decision to drop a ban on conversion therapy for trans people. “It’s kind of amazing that the appointment of deputy chief of staff can change the whole strategic direction of government,” one backbencher told the Times (£) recently. “But that’s a reflection of Boris. For Boris it doesn’t matter what the policies are, as long as he’s still prime minister.” *** Backbenchers are dragging the government to the right When Johnson won an 80-seat majority in the last election, it was hailed by some as a chance for him to show his true colours as a “one nation” Tory or – in his own words – a “Brexity Hezza” who believed Tories should be “the warriors of the dispossessed”. But there is plenty of evidence to suggest that the threat of his removal has been enough to neuter those instincts and force him to pander to the most rightwing voices in his party. “All that’s gone out of the window,” Rafael said. “Johnson knows the underlying dynamics of his party well enough to understand that when you are unpopular, the bit of the party you have to be wary of is the faction that has done in just about every Tory leader in our lifetimes.” Indeed, one MP, described as a senior Brexiteer, told the BBC’s Newsnight last night: “We have to destroy Boris Johnson for the sake of this country and the sake of our party.” That might explain why Johnson delayed – or dumped – measures designed to attack Britain’s obesity crisis, like an end to “buy one get one free” deals on junk food and a pre-9pm watershed for TV advertising. Meanwhile, there are fears the government could soon ditch some of its net-zero commitments, an attack on Channel 4, the abandonment of animal cruelty legislation, and draconian measures against the right to protest. “There was no reason to jettison the obesity stuff other than to appease the mindless libertarian wing,” Rafael said. “I’d keep an eye on the deadline for replacing gas boilers, too.” Not for nothing did right-wingers Peter Bone and Desmond Swayne leap to Johnson’s defence even before the Sue Gray report was published. “They don’t like Boris, and they don’t trust him,” Rafael said. “But they like having a wounded prime minister, who believes in nothing, and bears the imprint of whoever last sat on him, and will always act in the interests of whoever he’s most afraid of.” *** Read more on the Sue Gray report “If being prime minister is to captain a ship, the Johnson of the Gray report commands a cruise vessel,” writes Peter Walker in his analysis. “One where the main task involves being amiable to passengers at the dinner table.” The Guardian’s leader: “Mr Johnson told MPs he took responsibility, but failed to explain how. The assertion was no more convincing than his affectation of humility.” John Crace’s sketch: “‘We are humbled,’ he said with a dismissive, regal wave of his arm. Except he wasn’t at all.” Sue Gray said she did not fully investigate an alcohol-fuelled gathering in the flat shared by the prime minister and his wife Carrie. Aubrey Allegretti reports on Tory MPs’ fears of a “cover-up”. ConservativeHome sees the prime minister’s secret weapon as boredom. “By simply hanging on in there, he has given much of the parliamentary party, and a majority of party members, the time and space in which to become sick and tired of his foes.” What else we’ve been reading It’s been two years since the murder of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.

The front pages\\nThere’s quite a contrast in how the papers report the findings of Sue Gray’s report. “Drinking, fights, vomiting: all in a day’s work, says PM” is the Guardian’s splash headline, while the Mirror says that the government was having parties and “Laughing at us all” while people were sacrificing and mourning alone during lockdown. The Metro picks up the comment from a senior aide to Boris Johnson as its headline – “‘We got away with it’” – and the i runs with the theme of Gray’s conclusion: “‘Failure of leadership’”. In Scotland the Record says “Tory party enough to make you sick”. For some editors, the Gray report is a damp squib. The Mail asks “Is that it?” and the Express has a similar “Really… is this what all the fuss is about”. The Sun declares that “The Party(gate) is over”. The Telegraph leads on “Sunak to extend energy bill relief”, although it does have a front page report headlined “Johnson denies cover-up of ‘Abba party’ at Downing Street flat”. Similarly, the Times leads on “Energy bill handouts to ease the big squeeze” with “Gray report vindicates me over No 10 parties, claims Johnson” as a second story. Today in Focus The Partygate saga culminated with the release of the Sue Gray report yesterday. Peter Walker and Jonathan Freedland analyse what it means for Boris Johnson.

In an effort to do something he went to local garden centres and plant nurseries to ask for donations to transform the area. Hayden-Smith had become a guerrilla gardener and began dedicating his time to reclaiming community spaces. The space came to be known as the Grenfell Garden of Peace, injecting sense of unity and togetherness into the area.

       "      <td>Getting jabs to the unvaccinated has never been more critical | Andrew Pollard and Brian Angus</td>\n",
       "      <td>More than ever before, we must look behind the reported Covid-19 numbers in hospitals and communities to understand what is happening in the pandemic. We also need to better understand how the pandemic is playing out among unvaccinated people, and those who have been vaccinated. To the public, the pandemic was and still is a silent pestilence, made visible by the images of patients fighting for their next breath and reporters at intensive care units talking about the fear of patients and the exhaustion of doctors and nurses from behind their fogged visors. This ongoing horror, which is taking place in ICUs across Britain, is now largely restricted to unvaccinated people. Generally, Covid-19 is no longer a disease of the vaccinated; vaccines tend to limit this suffocating affliction, with a few exceptions. If the protection that vaccines offer against severe Covid-19 began to wane, given that tens of millions of people are now vaccinated in the UK and only a fraction of the population have not received the jab, ICUs would be filled to the brim with vaccinated people. But they are not. Vaccines still seem to give almost complete protection against this form of life-threatening cases of Covid-19. The latest wave of the virus in the UK – with cases rising rapidly in parts of Europe – will directly translate into a stream of mostly unvaccinated patients entering ICU. In the short term, boosters and social restrictions will help prevent Covid-19 from spreading among people who are unvaccinated this winter. But in the long run, the pressure of Covid-19 on ICUs won’t be solved through these measures. The virus will eventually reach unvaccinated people. To prevent serious illness, these people need first and second doses of the vaccine as soon as possible. It is therefore obvious that governments with doses to spare should be making every effort to ensure vaccines urgently reach people who are undecided and unvaccinated. Some countries are already hoping to drive uptake among this group by imposing social restrictions or introducing vaccine mandates. But understanding and dealing with people’s underlying objections to vaccinations would be a visionary project to secure the public’s health, during the pandemic and beyond. In countries with lower vaccination rates, the impact of the current wave on hospital ICUs will be far worse than in Britain. As a proportion of the whole population, vaccination coverage in the UK is 69%, but in Bulgaria it is only 24% and in Slovakia 43%. It is also important to address pockets of unvaccinated people in countries where vaccine uptake is otherwise high. In the US, for example, fewer than 50% of people have received both jabs in certain states. In other states, the rate is 70%.\\nIn this context, it is shameful that in some low-income countries only 5% of the population have received at least one dose, almost a year since the first licensed dose was given in Britain. The director general of the World Health Organization expressed his deep concern last week that there are now six times more booster doses being administered every day than first doses. We are still not doing enough to end the pandemic for the world’s unvaccinated, and governments and manufacturers urgently need to work together to get doses to those in low-income countries, keeping an eye on the long-term gains of global vaccination, despite the challenges posed by the current Covid spike in Europe. For those of us fortunate enough to have already been vaccinated, the story now seems very different. For the most part, we are protected from very severe cases of Covid-19. But it is now clear that even the fully vaccinated can get mild infection with the virus: the effectiveness of two-dose vaccines against mild symptomatic infection now ranges from 44% to 63%, according to the UK Health Security Agency. This lower level of protection is partly a feature of waning immunity against mild infection. It’s also a result of the Delta variant, which is better at infecting people than its predecessors, even when they have vaccine immunity. For most vaccinated individuals, these mild infections are little more than an unpleasant inconvenience. But for those who are very frail, immunocompromised or have underlying health conditions, these infections are enough to destabilise them and lead to hospital admissions, which is what happens every winter with other viruses, including flu. For some, these are serious, life-threatening health problems that add to the pressure on the NHS. But this situation is not the same as the one we faced last year. It’s also worth remembering that while daily hospital admission data includes people with Covid-19, these numbers may also include people admitted for an unrelated illness, an accident or indeed for elective surgery who happened to have tested positive for Covid. It is difficult to know the true burden of disease in hospitals when the background rate of infection in the community continues to be high. Booster doses drive up the antibody levels that are needed to prevent infection. According to recent figures from the UKHSA, they appear to increase protection against Covid-19 to at least 93%. As a consequence, they will help to drive down the number of Covid-19 cases in the community, and reduce the chance that milder infection will occur among vulnerable people that result in hospital admissions. In highly vaccinated regions where the supply of doses is not limited, this is good news. But we don’t yet know how long this boost to protection will last. We need better and cleaner clinical data to understand fully which patients are being admitted to hospital, to improve our assessment of how effective vaccines are at preventing hospital and ICU admission, and to assess who would be most likely to benefit from boosters. It is also important to monitor and assess the duration of the top-up protection afforded by boosters to then inform the best long-term strategy for future control beyond this winter. What this means for people who are vaccinated is that we have our first glimpses of what “living with the virus” might look like, though it will be some time before it is clear where or when this will all level out. There are still questions over whether we will need regular boosters, and who these should target. But the horrors of the pandemic continue unabated for the unvaccinated, who remain at risk wherever in the world they live. We have to do better at delivering first doses to these people by addressing the unequal access to vaccines across the world, and the barriers that exist to vaccine acceptance among some communities.

       "      <td>Randy Andy, Air Miles Andy, and now the Duke of Hazard: headline writers have always found evocative ways to shorthand the Queen’s second son at different stages in his royal career. As the Duke of York, 59, is spotted teeing off at the Real Club Valderrama, the exclusive golf club in Sotogrande, southern Spain, coverage of his controversial former friendship with the disgraced billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein continues to make uncomfortable reading for Buckingham Palace. Once the pilot prince, photographed with a rose clamped between his teeth at a hero’s homecoming following the Falklands war, his public image is now a disaster. The latest optics are grainy video of him at Epstein’s New York mansion, amid reports of royal foot massages dispensed by young women. The duke, first named in US court documents in 2015, has issued outright denials over allegations he had sexual encounters in 2001 with Virginia Roberts, now Giuffre, when she was a 17 -year-old masseuse for Epstein. The claims were struck from the US court record by a judge who described them as “immaterial and impertinent”. Also vehemently denied are allegations, in recently released court papers of the Guiffre case, made by Johanna Sjoberg that Andrew touched her breast while sitting on a couch at Epstein’s home in 2001.\\nWhen the video footage of Andrew waving off a young woman from the convicted sex offender’s residence emerged this month, an equally strong statement, through Buckingham Palace, said the duke was “appalled” by the recent sexual abuse claims levelled at Epstein, 66, who killed himself in jail on 10 August while facing sex trafficking charges. “His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent,” it said. There can be no denial, however, about Andrew’s crass lack of judgment. That video, and a photograph of him walking with Epstein in New York’s Central Park, were taken in 2010 – two years after the billionaire was convicted of soliciting a minor for prostitution and was a registered sex offender. “The situation changed when Epstein was convicted. It was [Andrew’s] conscious decision to stay loyal, to not criticise his friend the convicted paedophile. And, while that may be fine for him, it’s a step too far. What it’s saying is the royal family tolerates this sort of behaviour,” said one veteran royal commentator, who has met Andrew on several occasions, and believes he should now step down from his public roles. Time and again, Andrew, who a courtier once reportedly described as having “a pompous level of self-importance”, has demonstrated an eye-watering lack of judgment. Palace staff have rated him the rudest of royals, according to reports. A secret cable, published on WikiLeaks in 2010, revealed a US ambassador describing Andrew speaking “cockily” during one official lunch, leading to a discussion that “verged on the rude”. He earned the soubriquet Air Miles Andy after the National Audit Office censured his helicopter habit in 2005, which included him spending £32,000 in one year flying to Scotland to the Royal and Ancient club at St Andrews in his capacity as captain. In 2011, following pressure over the Epstein connection, he stood down from his role as UK special representative for trade and investment. It did not help when his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, admitted having accepted £15,000 from Epstein to help pay off her debts. His links have often raised eyebrows; meetings with the Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi’s son Saif; entertaining the son-in-law of Tunisia’s ousted president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali at Buckingham Palace; his relations with Timur Kulibayev, son-in-law of the then president of Kazakhstan, who purchased the duke’s Sunninghill Park home for £3m more than its £12m asking price in 2007. “Rightly, or wrongly, there is a perceived air of arrogance about Andrew, and he is described by various people as boorish and very self-centred,” said Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty Magazine. “Perhaps we shouldn’t be judging the book by its cover. But, certainly, that’s the impression he has given for a very long time.”\\nAndrew’s loyalty to his seemingly perpetually broke former wife, famously photographed having her toes sucked by her “financial adviser” before their 1996 divorce, remains clear. The two live under the same roof, Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park, and are currently holidaying together in Sotogrande. Even after Ferguson was caught trying to sell access to her ex-husband to an undercover reporter for £500,000 – of which the duke denied any knowledge – they remain close. Andrew’s friendship with Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the notorious press baron Robert Maxwell, and a close friend of Epstein’s, first surfaced in 2000 when they appeared together at private parties and celebrity functions in the UK and US. Today he is patron of some 200 charities and organisations, and the Prince Andrew Charitable Trust supports young people, healthcare issues and the participation of the disabled and wounded service personnel in sporting activities. His Pitch@Palace initiative, which links tech entrepreneurs to people who can help their business, is his “passion project” which he has taken global. Long-rumoured to be the Queen’s favourite son, she has made her support clear. The day after Epstein was found dead in a Manhattan jail, Andrew was photographed beaming alongside his mother on the way to church in Crathie, near Balmoral. She made him a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order in 2011, one month after it emerged he had seen Epstein during a private trip to New York. His fate is that of the typical second son, struggling to find a role. “I think despite knowing he was always going to go down the line of succession, the fact that in his youth he was second in line to the throne, and now he is wherever he is, that must be quite a blow to your confidence and feeling of importance,” said Little. • This article was amended on 26 August 2019 to correct the spelling of Timur Kulibayev’s name and clarify that his father-in-law is no longer the president of Kazakhstan.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Poverty is largely “a state of mind”, housing secretary Ben Carson has claimed, dismaying observers who had modest hopes for his tenure. Carson, the neurosurgeon who heads the agency charged with helping low-income Americans gain access to affordable housing, told Sirius XM radio: “You take somebody who has the right mindset, you can take everything from them and put them on the street, and I guarantee in a little while they’ll be right back up there.” He went on: “And you take somebody with the wrong mindset, you can give them everything in the world, they’ll work their way back down to the bottom.” Poverty and homelessness experts were quick to condemn the remarks.\\n“Every time he says something like this it suggests to me that the mindset of the secretary is just completely out of line with the mission of he department that he’s been selected to run,” Fred Karnas, a senior housing and urban development (HUD) official in the Clinton and Obama administrations, told the Guardian. Karnas said he had had felt “cautious optimism” when Carson was confirmed – former colleagues of his had met Carson to discuss redressing housing discrimination, and expected pushback, but the conversations went well. But he said he was “appalled” by Carson’s latest remarks. The real roots of poverty, Karnas said, “are related to access to employment, access to quality education, obviously racism”. This disappointment in Carson was echoed by Diane Yentel, head of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. After Carson’s confirmation hearing in January, Yentel said the new housing secretary had “clearly taken the time to begin to understand and come to appreciate the importance of HUD’s programs”. In response to his comments yesterday, however, she criticized his “tired &amp; offensive cliches” in a tweet. Robert Reich, the secretary of labor under Bill Clinton, tweeted: “So 15 million American children in poverty just need better attitudes and they’ll have food in their stomachs and roofs over their heads?” Carson’s comments were not the only cause for concern for those working on poverty-related issues this week.\\nThe Trump administration’s 2018 budget calls for cuts of $6.2bn, or 13.2%, to HUD, alongside deep reductions in expenditures on Medicaid and food stamps. Although Congress will ultimately come up with its own spending plan, the president’s budget is taken as a reflection of his philosophy and priorities. Carson did not seem fazed by the possible slimming down of his agency. The budget proposal “reflects this administration’s commitment to fiscal responsibility while continuing HUD’s core support of our most vulnerable households”, he said in a statement, and states, local governments and the private sector were intended to pick up the slack. Carson was always an unlikely choice for his job. His experience in government is essentially limited to his 2016 presidential candidacy, and he is known for zany pronouncements – for instance, that the pyramids were grain storehouses rather than pharaonic tombs. This seemed of little concern to his supporters; during his confirmation hearing, Senator Mike Rounds said that “probably running this department is not really brain surgery.” Still, Carson’s hardscrabble upbringing – an adviser said his “mother worked three jobs at a time to keep them out of public housing” – and his medical background had suggested to some that he might bring empathy and a valuable perspective to the role. For one man currently experiencing poverty, Carson’s charge about his mental state rankles. “I challenge Ben Carson or anyone of his choosing with the ‘right mindset’ to step into my life on the streets,” said Brett Anderson, a homeless man who resides with his family in an RV in San Francisco. It would not be so easy, he said, to find a way out.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Stressed out by Brexit? I have a mindfulness exercise for you, one guaranteed to bring calm. Instead of imagining a deep, cool lake or a beach of bone-white sand, comfort yourself by imagining the day, several years from now, when a Chilcot-style inquiry probes the epic policy disaster that was Brexit. As you take deep breaths, and with your eyes closed, picture the squirming testimony of an aged David Cameron under sustained interrogation. Look on as Boris Johnson is at last called to account for the serial fictions of the 2016 campaign. Or perhaps contemplate the moment the panel delivers its damning, final report, concluding that this was a collective, systemic failure of the entire British political class.\\nLast night’s series of votes in the Commons will provide a rich batch of evidence. Almost everyone involved, from both main parties, showed themselves to be immersed in delusion, trading fantasies and absurdities, each one refusing to meet reality’s eye, let alone tackle it head on. Most culpable, once again, is the prime minister. If our jaws weren’t already slackened to numbness by the last 30 months, they should have hit the floor at this latest performance. Theresa May had repeated endlessly, and for weeks, that her deal was the only deal on offer. Yet there she was, standing at the despatch box urging MPs to vote for an amendment that trashes that very same deal. The Brady amendment, which passed by 16 votes, demands what May had constantly said, up until yesterday morning, was impossible: the replacement of the Northern Irish backstop with “alternative arrangements”. It’s an extraordinary thing, this ability of May’s: she somehow manages to combine grinding intransigence with a willingness to perform the most brazen U-turns. Cheering her on was a Conservative party celebrating the rare thrill of unity. For the first time in ages, they could all be on the same side, declaring with one voice that what they really wanted was May’s deal minus the backstop. They beamed as if this result meant something, when it is in fact triply meaningless. First, it’s really no great achievement to get MPs to agree that they’d like the good bits of a deal but don’t want to swallow the bad bits: yes to the sugar, no to the pill. The Tories have united around a position that says they’d like the benefits of the withdrawal agreement, without paying all the costs. It’s the familiar Brexit delusion, which Brussels took all of six minutes to crush, by declaring – for the millionth time – that “the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation.” In other words, what the Daily Mail calls “Theresa’s triumph” is to have got her party to unite behind a stance that is doomed to fail.\\nBut even on its own terms, the vote is hollow. For what did MPs vote for but “alternative arrangements”? Not a specific, detailed counter to the backstop, spelling out concrete ways that a hard border might be avoided, but the nebulous promise of an “alternative”. When you don’t like x, then “not x” looks mighty alluring, not least because it can mean whatever you want it to mean. Brexiteers know the truth of that, because it was that same logic that saw them win the referendum itself. Their message back then boiled down to: do you want to stay in the European Union, with all its concrete, visible flaws, or would you like “alternative arrangements”? What we’ve all learned since is that the moment an “alternative” becomes real, it loses its all-things-to-all-people appeal. Which means that, even if Brussels were to relent and offer a revised proposal to the backstop, the new plan would enrage as many people as it would please – and would likely face rapid rejection by the Commons, by the Brexiteers swiftest of all. But the obloquy should not belong to the Tories alone. MPs had the chance to prevent the national cataclysm of a no-deal crash-out last night – and they refused to take it. They rejected Yvette Cooper’s amendment, which would have made such an exit impossible, thanks in part to 14 Labour rebels who concluded that even a slight delay to Brexit – just a few months – poses more of a threat to their constituents than a crash-out that could see shortages of food and medicine, with more warnings along those lines coming this morning from the leader of a major hospitals group. The future public inquiry into this horror show will damn those 14 especially. Instead, MPs voted for a toothless, non-binding amendment that confirms they don’t like no-deal very much, but are ready to do precisely nothing to prevent it. And while the Tories are still chasing unicorns, Labour is in its own fantasyland. Incredibly, shadow cabinet minister Richard Burgon was on TV last night still mouthing the same vacuities about “Labour’s alternative” Brexit and how it’s going to negotiate a “strong single-market relationship” – all the benefits, none of the costs – as if there isn’t only a matter of weeks to go till Britain leaves the EU. This just 24 hours after the party had embarrassed itself by planning to abstain on Tory legislation ending the free movement of people, only to reverse position 90 minutes later following a backlash on Twitter. The Sir John Chilcot of the future will note all this, even as she or he exempts the handful of MPs who are using every parliamentary wile they can to stop the country from slamming into the iceberg. The names Grieve, Cooper, Boles and others may earn themselves an admiring footnote in the report that will eventually come. But as for almost everyone else: they will be slammed for their role in a saga that disgraces this country and its supposed leaders more with each passing day. • Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</td>\n",

       "      <td>France’s CGT trade union has been accused of a “scandalous” attempt to lean on the press after it prevented almost all of Thursday’s French national newspapers from being printed, as part of escalating nationwide strike action against the government’s changes to labour laws. The union’s strikers shut off printing presses and distribution and allowed only one newspaper, the leftwing daily L’Humanité, to be printed after it agreed to the union’s demands to publish an opinion piece by the CGT leader, Philippe Martinez. This sparked accusations from newspaper editors of a “shameful” attempt to pressure the media. It has emerged that CGT representatives contacted the French newspaper editors’ union on Wednesday, saying they insisted that every daily paper run a pre-written communique by Martinez, in which he called for the government proposalsto be abandoned.\\nL’Humanité, which was formerly the official publication of the French Communist party and which, although it has long been independent, retains strong ties to its political roots, was the only paper to publish the release. All other daily papers were prevented from publishing by the union, which shut off the printing presses on Wednesday night. “The CGT has decided to block the printing of newspapers who refused to publish, under constraint, a tract calling for the government to withdraw its labour laws,” said Nicolas Beytout owner of L’Opinion daily, in an online editorial. “This scandalous intrusion by the union into the content of the media must be denounced as a deplorable attack on democracy,” he added. Laurent Joffrin, the editor of the left-leaning daily Libération told France Inter radio: “We’ve never published a communique under pressure and we never will.” He denounced a “shameful and stupid” demand by the CGT.\\nDidier Lourdez, from CGT, told France Inter that the union had made “no demand, no diktat” but that the CGT had proposed that all papers give space to Martinez’s communique. “The freedom of the press and democracy have to work in both senses,” he said. “It’s us who are being held hostage by the government which wants to apply this law.” The newspaper editors’ union, the Syndicat de la Presse Quotidienne Nationale, said in a statement that newspapers were being held hostage by the union in a political dispute with the government that had nothing to do with newspapers. “Our readers are the victims,” the statement said. During the last two months of protests against the law, newspapers have been stopped from printing and distributing on two previous occasions in March and April.

       "      <td>As I write, rumours are swirling around that there’s going to be a shortage of champagne in the run-up to Christmas. It seems hard to credit given the squillions of bottles the Champenois produce every year, and it doesn’t exactly come into the same league of inconvenience as petrol shortages, but if you enjoy a glass of bubbly on New Year’s Eve and want to get it at a reasonable price, there’s no harm in picking some up now. According to Rob Cooke, chief commercial officer of Majestic, it’s not so much that there will be a shortage than that shoppers may not be able to find their favourite champagne at a discounted price. “The choice will be: do you stick with your normal brand if it’s not promoted, change brands or go for another sparkling wine?” Cooke’s hunch is that champagne still ticks the box for most when it comes to celebrations, so Majestic is focusing on lesser-known labels such as the smart, modern-looking 12% Labbé et Fils Brut Tradition, which sells for £27.99 as part of the store’s mix-six deal (which can be any wines, not just champagne). Unless, for you, the point of drinking champagne is that your guests should recognise what you’re pouring for them, this is a good strategy. Own-label champagnes such as the Tesco Finest Premier Cru below or Adnams’ very decent house champagne (£23.99, 12.5%) cost considerably less than big household names such as Moët or Veuve Clicquot. And if you appreciate champagne as a drink rather than a status symbol, you can get a top-quality growers’ champagne for the price of a basic grand marque. The other thing I’ve noticed is that champagne is getting even richer and toastier than it used to be, partly due to recent good vintages and partly to the higher proportion of dark-skinned grapes (pinot noir and pinot meunier) many houses are using. This is great if you’re planning to drink it with a meal (champagne is actually terrific with turkey), perhaps less good if you want it as an aperitif. “There’s an increasing polarisation between this and the very lean and mineral style,” says Cooke. “The middle ground is disappearing a bit stylistically.” If you like a lighter style, look for non-vintage rather than vintage champagnes, a lower “dosage” (the sugar solution that is added at bottling) or blanc de blancs – champagnes that are made purely from white-skinned grapes, generally chardonnay.

       "      <td>It was the day after 322 Conservatives voted against feeding the nation’s poorest children over the holidays. Social media, indeed all media that way inclined, had been full for many hours of people wondering how these MPs could possibly live with themselves. (The children’s minister! How can a children’s minister vote this way?) Certain Tory MPs – for brevity, the dumb ones – had taken to Twitter themselves to meansplain to the campaigning Marcus Rashford that the responsible stewardship of a nation involves keeping children hungry. Because numbers. And they say so. I tried to work out which Tory war game this related to. Are we talking your basic Sun Tzu: when your enemy is choleric, make him angrier by interning 1.3 million kids in a state of famishment? Is it more of a culture war: really whip up that base of people who hate virtue-signalling by selecting one fundamental human virtue, empathy, and kicking it to death? Which Facebook subculture is this meant to appeal to? Simultaneously, I was on the phone to my friend C, not 100% listening while she was saying something about spaghetti bolognese. “Do you think you can make bolognese at scale?” she asked. Sure. I once made a venison cobbler for 35. I can do anything. “OK, I’ve emailed the head. In every school there are those who can and those who can’t. He knows that.” Wait, what? “It probably wouldn’t take more than 10 of us.” It turns out that now the food-voucher plan has been voted down, she wants the school to stay open over half-term, and then we would cook, and whoever was hungry would just come in for lunch. Even the first bit is a completely mad idea. Never has a half-term been more devoutly wished for than this October’s, after six weeks of masks, bubbles, exhausted teachers, disoriented year sevens, panicking year 11 and 13s and everyone and everything in between. C and I have known each other since the kids were in reception, nine years ago. We used to talk a lot at the gates, but when they get to secondary school, there’s a determined teacher standing at the entrance saying “Bye Mum!”, so around that time we had to just admit we were friends, and socialise in the regular way. We don’t talk a lot about politics, and our politics aren’t the same, though we’ve had a number of discussions about Keir Starmer’s hair. I would say she’s a good barometer for me of what people think if they aren’t refreshing Twitter all day long, but that would be to overstate my engagement with the outside-Twitter world. Mainly, we talk about why Mr Z went to work without his wedding ring on (yes, really, this morning), and why Mr C needs four monitors in his home office (nobody knows), and the minutiae of being in the sandwich generation, caring for both kids and ageing parents, and how we wish we were the bread bit, not the middle bit. Listening to her mad spaghetti idea, what I realised – and I don’t think those Conservative MPs do (is it because so many of them privately educate their children, or their income depends upon their not realising it?) – is how viscerally everyone is affected by this. In a way, the less left-leaning and political they are, the more they abhor it, having none of the emotional insulation of thinking: “Same old Tories.” The poor are not a separate category that Channel 5 can make a discrediting documentary about. These are either your children or they’re your children’s friends. They live in your house, or they hang out in your house. You still have a pair of their pyjama bottoms from when they were in year four, or you’re missing a pair. You remember when their brother broke his arm. You remember the time they got a new coat that had stars on it, in 2015. It is impossible to exaggerate how connected parents are to each other’s children, even if actual conversations are so limited (“please”, “thank you” on their side, “don’t do that, you’ll break it” on yours) that it would be hard to discern from the outside. They don’t have to be at a cute age. You could no more live with the idea that a 14-year-old standing in front of you hasn’t had breakfast than you would walk past a two-year-old who was lost in a supermarket. This is where the self-styled neutral commentators hit the hard limit of their comprehension. They will show you polls that say 40% of the country agrees that children are hungry because their parents spend all their money on Netflix; they will point to callous comments under articles, and get in your grill with the hard reality of demographics, that the over-65s agree with Ben Bradley and there are more of them than there are of you. But what this analysis doesn’t get – and I don’t think Sun Tzu gets either, although needless to say I haven’t read him – is the asymmetry of feeling. Not caring is a relatively mild state, that you wouldn’t cross the street for. Caring is a hot and urgent state that preoccupies your mind. And a cottage bolognese industry is not the answer, but it’s closer to it. People are not walking on by, and they will not let this drop.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Donald Trump skipped the G20 summit’s “Pandemic Preparedness” event to visit one of his golf clubs on the same day that a record 195,500 new Covid-19 infections were reported in a 24-hour period in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins. The summit, attended by world leaders from across the globe, is being held virtually this year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has now killed more than 250,000 Americans – by far the largest total in the world.\\nTrump’s apparent disinterest in the summit started earlier on Saturday when he started tweeting about the election results after the scheduled start time of the summit at 8am ET. The president appeared via video link during the summit’s opening remarks but by 10am, Trump was leaving the White House to go to his golf course outside of Washington DC, according to CNN. The event featured remarks from leaders, including the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, and was focused on the “coordinated response to the coronavirus pandemic and improved global pandemic preparedness”, according to its description. Before he left the White House to go to the golf course, Trump implied to leaders that he will be working with them in the future, a reference to the losing fight he has put up against the results of the presidential election. “I look forward to working with you again for a long time,” he told leaders, according to audio obtained by the Observer. Since Joe Biden was declared the winner of the election 7 November, leaders from around the world have congratulated Biden, including Macron; the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson; and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, acknowledging his victory even while Trump has refused to. According to a tally kept by CNN, Trump has visited one of his golf clubs on 303 occasions during his four years as president. During his 2016 campaign for the White House Trump regularly attacked his predecessor Barack Obama for hitting the links too often and insisted that he would have little time to play golf himself as president as he would be working too hard.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Lack of European fans will magnify US team’s home advantage at Ryder Cup | Ewan Murray</td>\n",
       "      <td>The vast array of superlatives attached to the Ryder Cup ignore the recent propensity for predictable outcomes. Since Europe trounced the United States in Michigan, 17 years ago, there has been just a single away victory. When that transpired, at Medinah, we all saw fit to brand it a “miracle”. The past three Ryder Cups have been won by the length of a par five.\\nFew events in sport do exaggeration better than the biennial joust of Florida-based millionaire Europeans and Florida-based millionaire Americans – and the Ryder Cup is all the better for such giddiness – but at some point the trend of home win after home win needs to be reversed. Foregone conclusions are no use to anybody with an interest in sporting merit. Padraig Harrington will subscribe to this theory, of course. Should Harrington lead Europe to glory at Whistling Straits in a month’s time, his career will have an outstanding team achievement alongside epic personal highs. The role of a Ryder Cup captain can sometimes be wildly overplayed but should Europe upset Bryson DeChambeau, Brooks Koepka, Dustin Johnson et al on their own patch, Harrington will be entitled to dine out on the triumph for years. Harrington may like to portray himself as an extrovert but he is also highly intelligent. His approach, including towards the opposition, will prove fascinating. Lost so far in the buildup to the 43rd staging of the Ryder Cup is the dynamic that will shift things heavily in favour of the United States. It lies in President Biden’s proclamation, barring entry to travellers from Europe. Such restrictions are often fluid but this one has held firm. It would be an extraordinary twist should golf fans from the UK, Ireland and Spain be allowed entry to the US in the final week of September. And with that White House-determined practicality, the Ryder Cup takes on fresh form. Home advantage will become an even stronger weapon in a competition that already looks formulaic on results alone. The PGA of America will not say what percentage of tickets have been sold to Europe-based fans. Those ticket holders are entitled to refunds, and they will surely be applied for due to the travel restrictions if they have not been already. The Ryder Cup’s official website states that “tickets sold directly through the PGA of America have sold out” and that “our plan is to host the 43rd Ryder Cup with full-spectator attendance”. That means tens of thousands in the galleries, each day. It seems logical to think 95% of them will be American, given that the away contingent is typically 10-15%. Even at that, their presence is felt.\\nIt must also be pointed out that some European fans live on the opposite side of the Atlantic. Shane Lowry rarely plays in a PGA Tour event without being roared on by someone in a GAA shirt. When an opportunity to watch a Ryder Cup so close to adopted homes in Chicago arose, many US-based European fans would have made plans. But the notion of a noisy delegation crossing the ocean in support of their brave boys, adding to the atmosphere in Wisconsin, is fanciful. There are senior UK golf executives who will not be able to attend. The European Tour’s own official party has been restricted because of travel rules. Those benefiting from vast marketing budgets may not want to admit it but this Ryder Cup cannot, by definition, be normal. Stars and stripes will dominate the scene. “Olé, olé, olé” will be reduced to a feeble murmur.\\nThere will be an early glimpse of what Harrington and his 12-man team can expect when Europe take on the United States in the Solheim Cup in early September. The LPGA last reported that event in Toledo is “all systems go” in respect of capacity crowds. Unlike the male equivalent, though, tickets do remain on sale for the match at the Inverness Club. Catriona Matthew’s European team are even bigger underdogs than Harrington’s. There remain matters worthy of more concern than whether or not Jon Rahm can be roared to glory against Tony Finau by men in Callaway caps and polyester polo shirts. Nonetheless, people see Ryder Cups as trips of a lifetime. More significantly, the event itself benefits from an element of rivalry in the galleries. In black and white, the United States and Europe playing each other at golf is not particularly a big deal. When tribal elements come into it and when players revel in the highly-charged atmosphere – for example, Rory McIlroy versus Patrick Reed in 2016 – its status is enhanced. “It’s just this amazing atmosphere with fans pulling for their team,” explained Jim Furyk. “You see players, like me, who are not usually emotional on the golf course, pumping their fists and screaming at the top of their lungs.” In 1927, boat decks were not crammed with Great Britain supporters before the inaugural Ryder Cup matches in Massachusetts. Now, however, this is an occasion of global standing. The recent British &amp; Irish Lions series in South Africa is not a particularly valid comparison either as there were no fans present. In the Ryder Cup, odds already stacked in favour of the hosts will be shortened further by supporters screaming almost entirely in one direction. Without being anybody’s fault, this merely adds to Harrington’s challenge and, without question, diminishes the spectacle.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Homo sapiens’ relationship with our long-lost relatives the Neanderthals has undergone a lot of rethinking since our relatively recent reintroduction in 1856. Until then, three years before Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species, we had no idea that they existed. Thanks to the Parisian anatomist Marcellin Boule, who “inaccurately reconstructed” a skeleton in 1909, the popular image of them has been of an ugly creature with a stooped spine and a “decidedly ape-like” appearance. Now, a blink of an eye later, we know that many of us – at least, those without sub-Saharan heritage – carry between 1.8 and 2.6% Neanderthal DNA. So it’s reassuring to read that these people whose genes we share were not the brutish caricatures of Victorian myth, but complex, clever and probably caring individuals with a lot to tell us about human life. Rebecca Wragg Sykes has studied their landscapes, territories and tools and emerges as an expert and enthusiastic character witness for Neanderthals and their way of life. In Kindred she looks at their “life, love, death and art”; and in the light of the fascinating evidence that is painstakingly presented here it seems likely that they had sophisticated tools, built home environments, art and ornamentation, family structures and possibly even “a richer culinary world than ours”. There is even evidence that they tidied up. Neanderthals probably didn’t have PR, but they do now.\\nNeanderthals became a distinct population 450,000 to 400,000 thousand years ago, and lived all over the world from north Wales to China and Arabia, in climates ranging from glacial to tropical, until about 40,000 years ago. They were shorter than we are, with strong arms for working hides and fine motor skills for making small tools, but probably saw, heard, smelled and possibly even spoke much like we do. With a sketch and a short piece of fiction at the start of each chapter, Wragg Sykes paints a vivid picture of life as lived by a Neanderthal parent, hunter or child. She doesn’t just want us to see Neanderthals for who they (probably) really were; she wants us to see their world through their eyes.\\nThe prose is a combination of the scholarly and the writerly, combining dizzying amounts of information about different types of stones, tools, bladelets and flakes with sentences such as “Squabbling crossbills and crested tits yielded to crass jays and mellifluous nightingales, until cold mornings saw clattering capercaillies sending breathy vapour into biting air.” The knowledge condensed here is certainly impressive. “The sheer amount of information is hard to process,” Wragg Sykes writes. “Few specialists have time to read every fresh article in their own sub-field, never mind the total scholarly output.” She describes, for example, how archaeologists refit tiny fragments of knapped artefacts back together like “an immense 4D jigsaw puzzle” to see how Neanderthals worked stone tools; what isotopes in dental calculus tell us about their diet and smoky fires; and how microanalysis of soil samples suggests careful placing – if not technically “burial” – of the dead. It’s clearly a subject that encourages and repays obsessive interest. Understanding Neanderthals’ place in history is important to show “how evolution didn’t follow an arrow-straight Hominin Highway leading to ourselves”, and to skewer white supremacist notions that sprang up around our early (mis)understanding of who different types of humans were. It is hard, though, not to draw some warnings for humanity from the fate of our near kin. Did Homo sapiens only thrive because of our larger and stronger social networks – “being welcome at the fires of friends many valleys away” when things got tough? Did Neanderthal populations collapse after one climate change event too many, and how might we survive our own? Or might they have been killed off by “a terrible contagion” that jumped between species? Sadly, we don’t know, though the next discovery may be the one to tell us. Until then, Wragg Sykes concludes, Neanderthals will continue to function as “the shadow in the mirror … a multispectral reflection of our hopes and fears, not only for their apparent fate, but our own”. • Kindred: Neanderthal Life, Love, Death and Art is published by Bloomsbury Sigma (RRP £20).

                                            Boris Johnson was crowned Conservative leader by MPs who knew he was lazy, unprincipled, and incompetent, a charlatan driven by one cause: himself. But there was a greater consideration than his suitability for high office, and that was his effectiveness as an antidote to the twin menaces of Faragism and Corbynism. If they did not recoup their electoral losses to the Brexit party, and disillusioned remainers flocked back to the Labour fold, Toryism faced an existential crisis that might parachute Jeremy Corbyn into No 10. Johnson was the panic button, to be pressed only in the direst of political emergencies. Uniquely, of any viable Tory candidate, Johnson met the challenge of the age of populism, and his Teflon qualities allowed him to revise Brexit red lines – throwing his unionist allies into the Irish Sea – to secure a deal that his supporters could make-believe would cause Brussels to cave. The Tories are the world’s most successful electoral force in large part because their ruthlessness vastly exceeds their sentimentality. Margaret Thatcher led her party to three successive, thumping wins, overturned Britain’s postwar social democratic order, smashed the trade unions and forced her opponents to capitulate to key tenets of her philosophy. Thank you very much, said her parliamentary party three years after her 1987 landslide victory, but now you must go because you have outlived your usefulness and become a menace to our prospects. Some wept as they betrayed her, and the price was a fratricidal Tory split that lasted for a generation; but it was a tolerable price for routing Neil Kinnock’s Labour party. Unlike Johnson, Thatcher was respected, admired and indeed loved by her party. The sole observable skill of our present incumbent is that he is an eccentric and successful campaigner. Which brings us to the danger of the present moment, in which Boris Johnson absorbs the blame for a national catastrophe for which his party is collectively responsible. After Theresa May – whose MPs once called her “Mummy” when she appeared master of all before her – self-detonated with the 2017 snap election, George Osborne described her as a “dead woman walking”. Yet her MPs preserved her zombie premiership for another two years, because she retained a vital role: let the coming inferno incinerate her career, then start afresh. Today’s Conservative parliamentarians are aware that Johnson is a byword for shambolic; and while the Brexit culture wars currently appear to offer a firewall – their electoral floor remains a stubborn 40% – the worst death toll and recession in Europe are eroding Johnson’s charismatic selling point, his can-do optimism. Keir Starmer’s Labour party has made competence their signature dividing line between them and the Tory administration. It’s a strategy that has historical precedent. Back in 1992, Labour collected rich political dividends after Britain crashed out of the European exchange rate mechanism despite having supported the country’s entry. Why not again offer no distinctive alternatives to the Tory pandemic response, pin the disaster on Johnson’s incompetence and win by default? The danger lies in underestimating Tory ruthlessness. The Johnson reboot targeted two key Tory weaknesses – the loss of its leave flank, and disillusionment with a decade of austerity – by promising a harder Brexit and targeted spending announcements in three distinctively popular areas: the NHS, schools and police. If Johnson is an obvious long-term liability – and if he has truly tired of the position he spent a lifetime craving, as the rightwing press speculate – then, like his predecessor, he will be surely kept in place until the worst is over and then disposed of. Should his reputation for competent economic management survive the next six months of restrictions, Rishi Sunak would be a natural candidate to replace Johnson. If he is savvy, he will replicate his predecessor’s trick of pretending to head an entirely new government that breaks definitively with the past, remorselessly jettisoning those most associated with the pandemic – so long Matt Hancock, and thanks for all the car-crash interviews! The first person of colour as prime minister would offer a convincing story of change. Faced with a new government, Labour would be forced to pivot from their current strategy. But there is another more compelling and honest dividing line. Britain was plunged into the abyss not by incompetence but by ideology. Lockdown was fatally delayed in a misguided attempt to protect business interests, ensuring both a deadlier outbreak and a greater economic hit, as consumer confidence dropped. The disastrously premature drive to force people back to the office – “or risk losing your job”, as the Telegraph put it exactly four weeks ago – put the interests of corporate property owners ahead of public health and again the economy. There was a lack of personal protective equipment because years of cuts meant stockpiles had diminished. Outsourcing led to a collapsed trace-and-test system, a disaster that should be attributed not to incompetence but to valuing private profit over the building of public infrastructure. As coronavirus restrictions are reimposed, Sunak’s soon to be withdrawn support measures – potential U-turns notwithstanding – will sacrifice livelihoods on the altar of Tory anti-state ideology. While incompetence can be pinned on to one disposable man, ideology is harder to scrub away. If unemployment increases and we see a Rishi Sunak recession, responsibility should be rooted in the very political nature of the Conservative party, not the maladroitness of one particular administration. Labour should fear the two “Rs” that have long preserved Tory hegemony – ruthlessness and reinvention. Starmer is competence incarnate; but, when Johnson is shuffled off without remorse, that may not be enough. • Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Lawmakers in Idaho are pushing to drastically reduce wolf numbers in the state, perhaps by as much as over 90%, complementing other US efforts to shrink their population. Idaho’s gray wolf population was recently estimated at 1,556, but sponsors of a bill approved in the state senate last week say that the preferred number of wolf packs in the state is 15. Because a wolf pack in the region averages 10 wolves, this means the bill could lead to hunters killing well over 1,000 wolves.\\nThe bill will see a vote in the state house of representatives today, where Republicans, who generally support the measure, hold a 58-12 majority. If successful, the bill will land on the desk of the governor for his signature soon after. Recent months have seen a dramatic reversal of fortunes for US gray wolves. Since the Trump administration removed Endangered Species Act protections from gray wolves on 4 January, interest groups and states moved quickly to weaken protections and open up hunting of the wild canine. Conservation groups quickly sued the federal government to relist the species. Until that lawsuit is resolved, or the Biden administration intervenes, management of wolves is up to the states. Wisconsin, which has a law requiring the state to hold a wolf hunt,conducted one soon after, resulting in hunters killing at least 216 wolves in less than 60 hours. A researcher estimated that an additional 115 wolves were poached, or illegally killed. The state’s hand was in part forced by Hunter Nation, a hunting organization founded by prominent Trump supporter Don Peay, which filed a lawsuit to force the state wildlife agency to hold the hunt. The Montana governor, Greg Gianforte, who was cited for breaking state hunting regulations in killing a wolf, recently signed a bill into law that would allow the state to reimburse wolf hunters and trappers for their expenses. In South Dakota, wolves were classified as predatory animals following de-listing, and can now be hunted and trapped, as the state leadership does not wish for the animals to establish themselves in the state. If passed, the Idaho bill would allow each hunter to use any methods available for killing other wild canines in the state, such as coyotes, which include the use of bait, spotlights at night, as well as electronic calls. It would also allow hunters to kill an unlimited number of wolves each year, increase the funding for the state’s Wolf Depredation Board to hire private contractors to shoot and trap wolves, and allow wolves to be snared and trapped on private land all year long. The Idaho fish and game commission, which is mandated to manage fish and wildlife in the state, opposed the legislation. Prior to near decimation via European colonization, wolves populated much of North America. The gray wolf, which the US Fish and Wildlife Service called “an integral component of the ecosystems to which it typically belongs”, was slowly recovered via conservation efforts, but has remained at the center of controversy ever since. Often perceived to be a threat to the hunting and livestock industries, the gray wolf has also been shown to make more resilient elk herds. Garrick Dutcher, research and program director for Living With Wolves, told the Guardian the Idaho bill is dangerous because “should the legislature set this precedent, they could wrestle away authority from the fish and game commission for other species as well”. He points out that the department of fish and game is staffed with biologists, while the state legislature is not. Dutcher contends that of the 2.5 million cattle in Idaho, fewer than 200 are lost each year to wolves. The number in 2020 was 84. “Every year, we lose far more to coyotes, to bad weather, to birth complications, and disease – orders of magnitude more,” he said. But Cameron Mulrony, executive vice-president of the Idaho Cattle Association, said the livestock and big game industries experience economic losses as a result of wolves. “A cow taken by a wolf is similar to a thief stealing an item from a production line in a factory,” he said. “The loss of a portion of a production line must be replaced, costing dollars. In addition the down time and loss of production while that replacement is put into place, and added to the line is an additional cost. Lastly, stress put on portions of any production line also create costs to the business.” Citing the rash of efforts to remove protections for wolves and hunt them, Amaroq Weiss, senior west coast wolf advocate for the Center for Biological Diversity, said that “all of the same political forces that have been at this for years have never gone away. Their effort is to undo whatever progress has been made, and if they could, eradicate wolves all over again.”   \n",

When the sun sets, long ribbons of burnt orange settle on the horizon. The flies and mosquitoes that come with the oppressive summer heat haven’t arrived yet. It is Magdalene Kleynhans’ favourite time of year. “You can sit outside until late into the night,” says the businesswoman, whose family spend much of their time outdoors. Her children fish from the banks of the Orange River whenever they choose. Kleynhans leaves the house unlocked. “It’s a good life. It’s a big privilege.” But there is much more to this small Northern Cape town than the bucolic ideal painted by Kleynhans. Incredibly, 25 years after the fall of apartheid, Orania is a place for white people only.\\nKleynhans runs one of Orania’s biggest enterprises: a call centre whose business is recruiting and retaining members for Solidariteit, a trade union primarily for Afrikaner workers, and Afriforum, a self-styled “civil rights” movement. Afriforum recently met with US president Donald Trump’s administration and Tucker Carlson of Fox Nows to tell them that Afrikaners are facing a widely discredited genocide. Both have made extensive investments in Orania’s construction boom. Oranians claim the town is a cultural project, not a racial one. Only Afrikaners are allowed to live and work there to preserve Afrikaner culture, the argument goes.\\nMagdalene Kleynhans owns a call centre that employs around 55 people in Orania The reality, however, is a disquieting and entirely white town, littered with old apartheid flags and monuments to the architects of segregation. While there are no rules preventing black people from visiting, those who live nearby fear they would be met with violence.\\nThe town has faced numerous calls for it to be broken up over the years, with prominent author and advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi arguing its existence violates South Africa’s successful dismantling of racial segregation. “Orania,” he says, “represents downright hostility to the idea of a single, united, non-racial country.” Large-scale eviction Orania was created in 1991, a year after Nelson Mandela’s release from Robben Island, and three years before the country’s first democratic election. Set among lush pecan nut orchards in the otherwise arid Karoo, it was set-up as an Afrikaner-only hamlet, not dissimilar from the ethnic Bantustans established under former prime minister, Hendrik Verwoerd, often dubbed the “architect of apartheid”.\\nBusts of former presidents of the town surround the statue of town mascot De Kleine Reus (The Little Giant), a young boy rolling up his sleeves, intended to symbolise the Oranians’ belief in self reliance\\nBy the end of the 1980s, the probability of losing control had already occurred to many Afrikaners, with some believing that impending democracy posed an existential threat to the white Afrikaans way of life. A few felt protecting that required becoming a demographic majority somewhere, rather than remaining a minority everywhere. So a small group of Afrikaners – Verwoerd’s daughter and son-in-law, Carel Boshoff, among them – purchased a strip of land on the southern banks of the Orange River, and went about setting up a volkstaat, or independent homeland, where Afrikaners would decide their own affairs.\\nOrania’s founders did not settle on virgin territory, but on the remains of a half-realised 1960s project to build canals and dams along the Orange River. A community of 500 poor black and mixed-race squatters who had made their homes in the buildings left behind by the project stood between the new owners and their whites-only vision.\\nBlack people are restricted to using the petrol station on the edge of Orania Speaking to the community after the purchase, Boshoff reportedly said he “did not buy a bus with passengers”. What followed, according to Cambridge historian Edward Cavanagh’s history of land rights on the Orange River, was one of the last large-scale evictions under apartheid. It was carried out by the future residents of Orania, with the assistance of beatings, pistol whippings and dogs. The population has doubled After three decades as a quiet backwater, Orania is booming. Its population – currently around 1,700 – has doubled over the last seven years. The most recent census estimates growth of more than 10% a year, outstripping most comparable rural towns and more, proportionally, than South Africa’s biggest cities. Population growth means a flourishing housing market and construction industry. Neat suburban homes have been joined by new apartment blocks and walkups which sell for as much as R1.5 million (£80,000), putting them on par with comparable homes in Johannesburg. There is an industrial zone of brick and aluminium factories which sell their products around South Africa. China buys most of the pecan nuts.\\nThe growth shows no signs of slowing. A sewage works meant to accommodate 10,000 future residents is in the pipeline. There are designs to transform the town’s humble technical training facility – where many of the skills driving the town’s new construction were taught – into a university. Not a single brick has been laid by a black worker. In a reverse of the usual situation in South Africa, all low-paying work in Orania – from keeping the town’s gardens to packing the shelves in its grocery stores – is performed by hard-up white Afrikaners. It is increasing numbers of poor labourers, whose tenancy is often less secure and who either rent or rely on subsidies from Orania’s cooperative bank, who are largely behind the town’s growing population.\\nAll low-paying work in Orania is performed by hard-up white Afrikaners. The town also has its own currency, the ‘Ora’. Orania is owned by the Vluytjeskraal Aandeleblok (Vluytjeskraal Share Block) company which, together with a series of internally elected bodies, is responsible for the town’s municipal decision making. People who want to live in Orania buy shares in the Vluytjeskraal Aandeleblok, instead of freehold. The screening of prospective shareholders allows for tight control. Buyers undergo extensive vetting, central to which is their fidelity to Afrikaans language and culture, a commitment to employing only white Afrikaners, and a string of conservative Christian undertakings. Unmarried couples, for instance, cannot live together. The town exists at the mercy of the South African constitution. In the early 2000s, a planned remapping of boundaries that would have brought Orania under the control of a democratically elected municipality appeared to spell the end, but the town successfully appealed to the high court using the constitutional rights of the country’s minority cultural groups. Pursued and harassed A quarter of a century after the end of apartheid, black people are restricted to using the filling station on the edge of Orania. Benjamin Khumalo* is one of them. The 55-year-old and his wife, who have lived on a small nearby plot since the 1980s, were once pursued and harassed by a pickup truck covered with Orania stickers when walking home after an evening with friends. “Now you must run,” he urged his wife, pushing her through a fence. “I’ll be behind you.”\\nKhumalo still remembers when Orania was a home for black families. The guns carried on the hips of many Oranians, however, have been enough to convince him never to enter the town again. “They will hurt you,” he says. “There is nothing we can do.” Unsurprisingly, Orania’s white residents have a different take. The town’s doctor, Philip Nothnagel, describes South African cities as “warzones”. He lived in the country’s administrative capital, Pretoria, before he moved to Orania. The 10 months since have been the best of his life, he says. “It’s the first time in history that a country has been established without a war,” he adds, sporting a Lincolnesque beard after he dressed up as Paul Kruger during recent celebrations of the Boer hero. “It’s like boere [white Afrikaners] Disneyland. Except you never have to go home.”\\nNoticeboards at a local restaurant carry a warning to European journalists. The spectre of Verwoerd, the architect of apartheid, is difficult to escape. His portrait and bust seem to be around every corner. His wife, Betsie, is buried in the town, and her old home has been converted into a Verwoerd museum. His grandson Carel Boshoff junior is a former leader of the Orania Movement, which first proposed the idea of Orania in the 1980s. Boshoff junior is perhaps one of the more unlikely fans of the pianist Abdullah Ibrahim, whose music plays on a laptop in his office. Like his parents and grandparents, Boshoff fears white Afrikaners face a real threat of “being wiped out”, either through violence or what he calls “amalgamation”. He believes the recent expansion of Orania is just the start.\\nVerwoerd’s grandson, Carel Boshoff junior, worries white Afrikaners could be ‘wiped out’ “We are something like the phoenix in the ashes,” he says. “The questions to which Orania is the answer are so fundamental to the structure of South African society that you can’t express and affirm your Afrikaner identity without coming to the conclusion of a bigger Orania.” Offended by Orania Orania has continued largely uncontested since its victorious appeal to the high court in the early 2000s. The ANC government does not appear to be considering an appeal of the high court decision. Zamani Saul, head of the ANC-run Northern Cape government, has said an inquiry into Orania’s legal status is yet to be concluded. For Ngcukaitobi, the author, Orania “represents the reversal of the constitutional project of national building.” The rights that underpinned the town’s high court challenge against the remapping are not unlimited, he says. Anyone who cares about South Africa “would rightly be offended by what Orania represents, which is an enduring legacy of racial mobilisation”.\\nOrapeleng Moraladi, Northern Cape secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, blames the town’s continued existence on the courts, an uncooperative Orania leadership, and a lack of political will from the ANC. “[The town] is like embracing an apartheid system within a democratic state,” he says. “Orania is an indictment of the government of South Africa.” *Indicated names have been changed Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter.

                 Benedict Cumberbatch will play the Soviet spy Alexander Litvinenko in Londongrad, an HBO limited series, Variety reported on Thursday. Based on the book The Terminal Spy by Alan Cowell, Londongrad will feature the Sherlock Holmes actor as Litvinenko, the former KGB agent turned defector who was fatally poisoned by the radioactive isotope polonium-210 in 2006.\\nCumberbatch, an early favorite for a best actor Oscar nomination for his role in Jane Campion’s western drama Power of the Dog, will also executive-produce the series under his SunnyMarch production banner. Londongrad is not the only TV project in the works about Litvinenko, who fell ill after meeting two Russian agents at London’s Millennium hotel and slowly died from the poison over the course of three weeks. David Tennant is set to play the former spy in a four-part ITV series that will cover the poisoning and his widow Marina’s campaign to persuade the British government to name her husband’s killers and acknowledge Russia’s responsibility. (In September 2021, the European court of human rights found Russia responsible for his death.) Litvinenko, who worked in Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) as an organized crime officer, fled to London in 2000, where he became a writer, journalist and outspoken critic of Vladimir Putin. From 2003 until his death, he was also a counter-intelligence officer, advising MI6 as an expert on Russian organized crime. As he lay dying in London’s University College hospital, Litvinenko worked with Scotland Yard detectives to solve his own murder, tracing the fatal cup of tea back to a former comrade in the Russian secret service. The ITV program, written by George Kay and executive-produced by Patrick Spence, does not have a release date yet. Neither does Londongrad, which will be written by David Scarpa, who was most recently a writer, executive producer and co-showrunner on the Amazon series The Man in the High Castle. Apart from starring in Londongrad, Cumberbatch will reappear as Doctor Strange in the Marvel movies Spiderman: Far From Home in December and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, set for 2022.   \n",

Shanghai, with the artists behind the song describing it as an attempt to “cheer up” tens of millions of residents locked down in China’s largest city amid a surging Covid outbreak and increasing restrictions. The song, Grocery Shopping, laments empty shelves and fights in the supermarket aisles, and is set to footage of residents crowding around market stalls, or lining up for PCR tests. “Set your alarm, wake up, food fight,” the lyrics say. “Order that tofu, but the sauce all gone.” The song’s release comes as Shanghai authorities expanded some lockdown measures and the city reported record daily case numbers in an outbreak city-wide frustrations. China is in the midst of its worst outbreak of the pandemic, driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant. Shanghai is recording the bulk of cases, with the city’s outbreak yet to peak. It reported 5,656 asymptomatic cases and 326 symptomatic cases for Tuesday, up from 4,381 new asymptomatic cases and 96 new cases with symptoms for the prior day.\\nIn response the city has been divided in two, with four day lockdowns and mass testing drives beginning on Monday for one half, and Friday for the other. However late on Tuesday, authorities announced lockdown measures in some areas of the currently free section. The south-west district of Minhang announced public transportation would be suspended until 5 April, and residents in some western districts received notice from their housing committees that they would be stopped from leaving their compounds for the next seven days. “We express our deepest thanks to all residents! We will resume normal life soon, but in the next period of time we ask everyone to adhere closely to pandemic control measures, do not gather, and reduce movements,” said one notice seen by Reuters. Social media messages also circulated that areas of Puxi would be locked down from Wednesday, a claim dismissed by authorities as “rumour”. For weeks Shanghai authorities were vociferously rejecting rumours there were plans for lockdowns, arresting at least two people for spreading wrong information. Then on Sunday, plans sharply reversed with the announcement of split lockdowns for the city of 26 million people. Shanghai residents have expressed growing frustration with the measures imposed on the city, particularly food shortages in supermarkets. Residents have reported rising costs for fresh produce, with jokes in groupchats about the empty supermarket shelves soon forcing them to eat the community shrubbery. Elderly people have reported struggling with the technology required for online ordering. Amid the restrictions and shortages the rap, released on Monday by artists named CATI2, PJ, and Keyso, has become a hit in the city. The Shanghai lyricists sing about food fights, people waking up early to order food only to find ingredients sold out and delivery drivers all busy. In another section PJ describes escaping one lockdown to get trapped in another. “Thinking it was an excellent idea to use music to cheer up the people of Shanghai and dispel the negative atmosphere online, the three of us got started immediately,” PJ told Sixth Tone. “We chose buying vegetables as the theme, because it is the challenge that sums this outbreak up the most. I’ve been to the supermarket to stock up on food many times, and each time I saw people pick the shelves clean. It was even worse than when they buy up groceries before New Year.”\\nThere is growing discontent with China’s zero-Covid policies and the subsequent lockdowns across cities and provinces as Omicron challenges China’s usual methods of containing outbreaks. Coupled with the fear among officials of punishment for failures, harsh and hasty measures have in some cases proved distressing, even fatal. In a repeat of January’s lockdown in Xi’an, where at least one man died and a woman miscarried after they were denied entry to hospital, refusal of medical care is again causing concern in Shanghai. Media reports have described dialysis patients – who receive life-preserving treatment about three times a week – denied entry to multiple hospitals. Last week a nurse in Shanghai died after she was denied entry to hospitals after suffering an asthma attack. Such refusals go against government policy, which has only requested hospitals suspend general outpatient services. Additional research by Xiaoqian Zhu   \n",

Rich, which is in the Top 10 of America’s country chart this week. “Because you’re a woman?” asks a fan, pressed up against the stage of this railway-arch venue. “Because I’m a woman,” Morris concurs. “And because we had to take ‘shit’ out.” The Nashville establishment may find sweary women a trial, yet Rich – a break-up song whose rap-minded lyric references Diddy and Benjamins – is a big hit, and Texas-born Morris one of country music’s most feted young singer-songwriters. Tonight’s acoustic one-off, hastily arranged simply because she fancied it, sold out in one minute. (A large-venue 2019 tour is penned in, along with the follow-up to debut album Hero.) The fuss stems from her gift for pairing storytelling (often told from the “ugly” point of view – “being the bad guy,” as she says of the swampy I Wish I Was) with walloping melodic hooks that cross genre lines to pop and R&B. Even presented as bare-bones traceries, her songs, like her voice, are luminous and characterful; in the case of her inescapable, Zedd-produced EDM hit The Middle, the acoustic treatment replaces its polar chill with warmth. Tiny and personable, she calls her new husband Ryan Hurd on stage and tackles a potentially mushy duet with the observation: “This is straight-up country shit.” A tribute to the victims of the Route 91 Harvest festival shooting in 2017 – she had played the day before – is elegant: moving yet free of sentimentality. “This gig makes me miss being a songwriter with a guitar,” she says at the end, facing a future where such gigs will be a rarity.   \n",

and two original members down – you can’t say they haven’t kept with the times. They’ve modernised their sound with the kind of “mature” chilly electronics popularised by the xx and that trip-hop beat that seems to be everywhere now, and they’ve updated their Shoreditch references too: instead of The Joiners Arms and cocaine, it’s the lobby of the Ace Hotel (Exes) and fennel tea (Into the Earth). Hymns, however, is let down by its ham-fisted “sensual meets spiritual” theme, and the fact that you can so clearly hear what Kele Okereke is singing. For every half-decent idea – the chamber chanting on Only He Can Heal Me, for example – there are cod-blues lyrics about praying down by the water (The Good News) or stomach-curdling lines such as “when we sex we hear the beat”. Guitarist Russell Lissack does his best to insert some typically wiry licks where possible, but there’s none of the claustrophobia or unease that used to make Bloc Party so vital.   \n",

Villa and join Sunderland instead. The deal would be a loan until the summer and is being sold as offering the former Newcastle United right back an opportunity of forcing his way back into the France squad for Euro 2016.\\nThings have not worked out for Debuchy since his £12m transfer from St James Park to Arsenal 18 months ago. The 30-year-old lost his place after a spell spent injured on the sidelines and he now accepts he has little chance of displacing Héctor Bellerín. Accordingly Sunderland have attempted to hijack Rémi Garde’s plan to move for his compatriot by holding talks with Arsenal over a proposed loan fee for Debuchy, who last appeared in Arsène Wenger’s first team in November. “Whatever happens, even if it is to return [to Arsenal] this summer and then start again, I have to go this winter. I cannot stay at Arsenal,” Debuchy said earlier this month. “As the weeks go by, we get closer to the Euros. I have to play to try to return as soon as March for the Netherlands and Russia friendlies. I would have preferred to leave Arsenal last summer but the coach told me that I would have my chance. Ultimately, it was not the case.” It all represents quite a come down for a defender who made it clear he regarded Newcastle as a mere stepping stone to bigger and better things. Allardyce already has three right backs in Billy Jones, Adam Matthew and DeAndre Yedlin but he is looking into the possibility of terminating Yedlin’s loan from Tottenham while Matthews is expected to join a Championship club before next week’s transfer deadline.   \n",

Terrifying to almost see you again. I smelled the shockwave, the burning air. You were too sexual To be bourgeois, screams from the jungle On top of Mount Olympus. You were too violently beautiful. Last night I looked up at the sky, Lights out as I was falling asleep. There was the moon, a full moon, or nearly. It was you. I wasn’t, but I could have been, A god I was living in. I chose not to come out On stage and tell them what a poem is about. Pubic hair that befits a goddess. Pubic hair that equips a goddess. That little arrowhead of pubic hair that Magnifies your thighs’ magnificence. You look like a field of flowers. You look like flowers in a vase. You look like brains and breasts. You are life stabbing death to death. I’m packing heat. That’s a poem. My concealed Carry permit is revealed. I do what I do. Peaches goes it alone. I was like a god or I was like the tiny hermit crab Who walks around inside a borrowed empty shell Bigger than he is for protection. I carry the shell I’ve borrowed like an umbrella Wherever I go Along the shore. I dress up in one of my million-dollar suits. I scuttle along Broadway, Ready to be found out and eaten Naked. A thunderbolt from you Walks through my front door And knocks me to the floor Where you and I, in love, still are On top of Mount Olympus Screaming your eternal estrus, Eyes white and blank with blind Ecstatic lack of sight.\\nBilly Collins paid Frederick Seidel a fine tribute, quoted on the Poetry Foundation site: “He does what every exciting poet must do: avoid writing what everyone thinks of as poetry.” Somehow, though, Seidel’s work challenges even this nuanced compliment. The formalist in him is strong, and, while his writing avoids the poetic conventions currently dominant, it clearly declares itself to be poetry. The fresh, sometimes raw, diction, the rangy swagger and unpredictability, make Seidel thoroughly contemporary and urban, but his verse is a re-developer of traditional poetry rather than its iconoclast. Hymn to Aphrodite is a rebel classicist’s poem, a brew of the sacred and profane, delivered gulp by gulp. Seidel appreciates the essential erotic paradox: “screams from the jungle / On top of Mount Olympus”. This cocktail is a feast in the final stanza, the speaker and the woman he loves seeming to scream themselves into marble, their “Eyes white and blank with blind / Ecstatic lack of sight”. Love’s blind, as everyone knows, particularly to the beloved’s faults. Seidel gives the blindness a transforming emphasis and amplification. The ecstasy of love is contingent, in fact, on the lover’s lack of sight. It’s a note of realism rather than sourness. The rekindling of love produced by the narrowly missed encounter with an “old flame”, also identifiable with the goddess of love, Aphrodite, is far from sweet and decorous. It’s “Terrifying to almost see you again”. This recalls the cold sweat and breathless trembling that the Sappho persona of the Fragments experiences so painfully in the presence of her lover. As often happens in Seidel’s poems, with the intensification of the emotion, rhyme comes flying in the stanza’s window. Sometimes, the device seems self-protectively to defuse the emotion or at least find its potential for comedy. This seems to be happening in the fourth stanza, whose subject is confession versus concealment: “I wasn’t, but I could have been, / A god I was living in. / I chose not to come out / On stage and tell them what a poem is about”. Nothing happens but everything is transformed. The speaker dreams the raw stuff of sexual romance – the moon (“ a full moon, or nearly”), the memory of the requisite magnificent thighs and, more poignantly, “that little arrowhead of public hair”. Masturbation appears to follows the reverie (“Peaches goes it alone” is also the title of the 2018 collection in which Hymn to Aphrodite originally appeared). The lover-poet, “packing heat” and inspiration, enters a godlike state: then “the tiny hermit crab … inside a borrowed an empty shell” puts on an expensive suit and hits the 21 miles of Broadway, New York’s now-mythical theatreland. The city-slicking is ritualistic and compulsive, like the worship of Aphrodite. The poem’s diction is smart and direct, but steeped in the old-fashioned rhetoric of Greek song-culture. Aphorism encompasses love’s biggest emotional truth: “You are life stabbing death to death.” Anadiplosis, a rhetorical device based on repetition, is no small help in fuelling the rhythmic force of these quatrains. Siedel, now aged 85, is among the outstanding contemporary American poets. His New and Selected Poems, just published in the UK by Faber, is the perfect introduction to an inimitable body of work.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Demands are growing for security around the houses of parliament to be enhanced as police seek to establish whether the terrorist who attacked Westminster had scouted the area for weak points. Video footage has emerged showing an entrance to the estate was left open in the immediate aftermath of Wednesday’s attack, in which five people including the attacker were killed and more than 50 injured.\\nThe footage shows the Carriage Gates, through which Khalid Masood entered the grounds of Westminster Palace where he stabbed PC Keith Palmer to death, left unguarded for several minutes. As armed officers swarm the cobbled forecourt of New Palace Yard after shooting Masood, the iron gate through which vehicles enter the yard is left wide open. No police officers are visible guarding the gates, pedestrians walk past and a courier on a moped appears to enter unchallenged. The video, obtained by the Times (£), fuelled concern that the attack could have been worse if Masood had had accomplices. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, the Conservative MP Nigel Evans said: “I’ve got no doubts whatsoever that there will be enhanced features of security, it’s happening on a regular basis, but following this tragedy, security has got to be upped at the same time as still having a welcoming hand to members of the public to come and see how democracy works.” Evans said many MPs who were locked in the Commons chamber during and after the attack were discussing how to boost security in certain areas. He said, however, that far more checks were carried out at Carriage Gates than at the time he was elected in 1992, when an officer would just “wave you through”. “I’ve got no doubts whatsoever that, under the speaker, that he is regularly in touch with the Metropolitan police, and that they will be talking about now, new security measures that will be there,” Evans said. Detectives were last night scouring large amounts of CCTV footage to see if Masood had been recorded scouting the Westminster area before his attack. The Guardian understands they are also using camera records and automatic number plate recognition technology to see if Masood was captured driving his rental car, a Hyundai four-wheel drive, around Westminster Bridge to calculate the best location to mount the kerb and inflict the most damage. At the same time, it is expected they will be looking for anyone else doing a similar thing to aid the attack, since which there have been 11 arrests and a series of vehicle seizures across the UK. The former Met commissioner Ian Blair told Today he was “absolutely certain that there will be a review now of the outer soft ring that those of us who work at the Palace of Westminster are very used to”. “Always behind it is the inner core of armed officers, but PC Keith Palmer has paid with his life for that soft outer rim and I think that his family at least, and everybody else, needs the reassurance that will be reviewed.” Lord Blair refused to criticise the officers who apparently left the gate unguarded, describing them as “human beings” who would have been “gripped completely” by the attack, while knowing armed officers were on their way. But he added: “I’m absolutely certain that there will have to be changes. People are used to the fact that if they go into Downing Street they are confronted by basically closed gates and armed officers and I’m afraid that’s what will have to happen, but we’ll leave it to the reviews to see what it is. But I don’t think there should be shock, horror about the fact the gates were open for a moment after that kind of attack.” Parliamentary authorities have previously been warned about the potential vulnerability of Carriage Gates. Around 5,000 people work on the estate and about 14,000 people hold parliamentary passes, while hundreds of visitors enter the building each day. On Friday, Mark Rowley, Scotland Yard’s anti-terror chief, said current arrangements were proportionate and that procedures for guarding parliament had been designed so they were not “overly intrusive”. “Our current arrangements have been developed with parliament over many years and are designed to provide access to the seat of our government balanced with security that is proportionate but not overly intrusive,” he said. The prime minister also defended security arrangements at parliament on Thursday, saying the UK should be clear that the attacker was unsuccessful in gaining access to the building. The security expert Prof Anthony Glees told the Guardian the attack had demonstrated a “lack of protection” within parliament, while there were “disturbing signs of chaos” in the way May was taken away from the estate. Counter-terrorism detectives have been investigating Masood’s life and associations across Britain in a race to discover what led him to run down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, crash his vehicle outside parliament and attack two police officers. A joint investigation by Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command and MI5 led to three further arrests on Thursday and early Friday in London, Birmingham and Manchester, with two of them still in custody. Properties were searched in Wales and southern England. It remains unclear whether the attack was carried out alone or with support or encouragement. Fears have heightened that Masood was either radicalised overseas or in prison. The Saudi embassy in London confirmed late on Friday that Masood had been in the country three times and taught English there, from November 2005 to November 2006, from April 2008 to April 2009, and for six days in March 2015. He had a work visa and was not tracked by Saudi security services because he didn’t have a criminal record in the country.\\nBut the 52-year-old, born Adrian Elms, was known at home for having a violent temper and had criminal convictions in the UK. A childhood friend told The Sun newspaper Masood had converted to Islam while in jail. “When he first came out he told me he’d become a Muslim in prison and I thought he was joking,” Mark Ashdown said. “Then I saw he was quieter and much more serious. I gave him some cash-in-hand work for a few months as a labourer. “He said he needed time to pray and read the Qur’an – something about finding inner peace. There were still flashes of the old Ade, but they were few and far between. “I heard he’d split from his partner and got even more deeply into religion. But nothing could have prepared me for hearing his name on the radio.” Detectives have so far seized 2,700 items as part of the investigation, including “massive amounts” of computer data, while they have had contact with around 3,500 witnesses. Searches at three addresses are continuing.   \n",

                                                 The federal government is paying a public relations firm $2.9m to help with its vaccine rollout for five months, including by copying vaccine data from its website and putting it in an email for journalists. The health department has previously refused to say how much it was paying Cox Inall Change, a public relations company, for the simple task of attaching a pdf copy of its vaccine data to an email to media outlets every day.\\nThe department’s contract with Cox Inall Change, published last week, shows the firm is receiving $2.9m as a “public relations agency to support Covid vaccine communication work” between August and the end of December. The money is not just paying for the daily emails to media. The firm is performing other communications work for government with a focus on reducing vaccine hesitancy. But the department has previously refused to answer questions about how much the daily email service is costing it or whether outsourcing it offers taxpayers value-for-money, particularly given the size of its own communications team. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\\n“Cox Inall has been contracted as part of the broader communications campaign,” the department said earlier this month. “They are undertaking a range of tasks including information booths at shopping centres to support people who wish to book a vaccination appointment to broader communications to support the vaccination program.” It said the daily data published by the Operation Covid Shield taskforce on the department’s website, and shared by Cox Inall in the daily emails, was an “accurate and up to date picture of the actual state of play with the rollout”.\\nThe firm sends the data in the same form, a pdf, as it is published on the website and adds no additional detail or context. It does not provide the data in more easily accessible formats for data analysts. “I am reaching out on behalf of the Australian government (department of health) to provide you with the latest data on total vaccine doses,” Cox Inall says in the daily email. “Our team will be sending an updated deck through to your newsroom each day to ensure you are up to date with the latest data for the Covid-19 vaccine rollout.” Cox Inall declined to comment. The health department said Cox Inall was conducting a range of communications activities for the government, including holding information booths at major sporting events. “A key role is to provide content for social media including videos such as those who have survived Covid and encouraging others to be vaccinated,” a spokesperson said. “Cox Inall’s role in providing information directly to newsrooms is important in ensuring the Australian public has accurate vaccine rollout information and such activities are standard practise for PR companies to undertake as part of the support role they are playing for the Department.”   \n",

                                                                                              China’s new ambassador to Australia has offered an olive branch in the intense diplomatic dispute between the two countries, saying they should “meet each other halfway” and “look into the future”. Xiao Qian, who arrived in Canberra in January after years of increasing tensions, said China attached “great importance” to the relationship and was willing to “actively develop friendship and cooperation with Australia”. The intervention comes just days after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, accused China of a dangerous “act of intimidation” over a Chinese warship’s shining of a laser at a RAAF surveillance plane north of Australia last week.\\nChina’s national defence ministry, in turn, accused the Australian defence force of “spiteful and provocative actions”. Xiao said in a speech on Thursday that the healthy and stable development of China-Australia relations served the fundamental interests and “common aspirations” of people in both countries. Given this year marked the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties, he said, there was an opportunity to ease tensions. “China is willing to work with Australia to meet each other halfway,” said Xiao, who previously was China’s ambassador to Indonesia. He said the two governments should “jointly make efforts” to push the relationship back on “the right track”. They should “review the past” and also “look into the future”. Xiao did not specify any tangible actions Beijing may take to get the relationship back on track – but clearly signalled he wants to talk. Later, he told SBS World News and the ABC: “The diplomatic channel is open.”\\nAustralian ministers have complained since early 2020 they have been unable to secure phone calls or meetings with their direct counterparts – although contacts have continued to occur at lower diplomatic levels. The Australian government accuses Beijing of engaging in “economic coercion” by hitting a range of Australian export sectors with tariffs, bans or other sanctions in 2020 – some of which are being challenged at the World Trade Organization. Both major political parties in Australia view the differences in the relationship with China as largely structural and therefore not something that can be fixed by adopting a different tone. China is particularly sensitive to criticism about human rights and the crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong and Australia’s longstanding position against using force or the threat of force to bring Taiwan under Beijing’s control. In recent months, Beijing has ramped up its criticism of new or renewed groupings such as the Quad and Aukus. Still, Xiao’s comments signalled a more open approach to dialogue, and contrast with a warning from his predecessor Cheng Jingye in April last year that Beijing would respond “in kind” if Australia followed other countries in imposing sanctions against its officials over human rights abuses in Xinjiang. On Wednesday, the former Australian foreign minister Julie Bishop added her voice to calls for Australia’s foreign policy and national security to “always be, as far as possible, bipartisan”. Bishop’s comments to the ABC’s 7.30 program follow growing attempts by the Morrison government to argue a point of difference with Labor over China in the lead-up to the May election. Politicisation of national security also triggered carefully worded pushback from the Asio chief, Mike Burgess. Xiao was speaking at an event at the Chinese embassy in Canberra to present the family of the late New South Wales police force officer Kelly Foster with a medal honouring her bravery. Foster died trying to save Chinese student Jennifer Qi in a whirlpool in the Blue Mountains in January last year. Qi also lost her life. Xiao told the audience – which included senior Australian federal police and NSW police force representatives – that Foster had displayed “the warmth of great love and humanity that transcend race, culture and nationality”.\\n“China and Australia are far away from each other geographically, by thousands of miles, yet great love knows no national boundaries nor distance,” the ambassador said. He said Foster’s “heroic act” had been widely reported in China, where millions of people “could feel the warmth, kindness and friendship of the Australian people”. The NSW police commissioner, Karen Webb, said the force felt the loss deeply. “It is a testament to her courage that she went immediately to Jennifer’s aid without a second’s thought for her own safety,” Webb said. Foster was posthumously awarded the Great Wall Commemorative Medal of China’s Ministry of Public Security. The national anthems of both China and Australia were played at the embassy event.   \n",
       "133515  Sunak’s opening remarks Rishi Sunak says his budget delivers a stronger economy for the British people: stronger growth, public finances and employment. The chancellor says he will give people the support they need with the cost of living and levelling up. He says the budget does not draw a line under Covid but does begin the work of building an economy post-pandemic. “Let there be no doubt: our plan is working,” he says. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: Sunak has adopted the prime minister’s claims that the UK needs to move to a “new economic model” of higher wages and productivity. He is sounding decidedly like a Johnsonian optimist, trumpeting better than expected economic growth, rather than focusing on fiscal discipline or balancing the books. He does, however, inject a note of caution about the threat of inflation, while insisting it is a global problem. Inflation The chancellor says inflationary pressures are affecting the UK economy, with the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasting that inflation will be above 4% next year. He says the pressures are global in nature and are “impossible for us to address alone”. However, the government will act to support households, he says. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: Sunak says he has written to the Bank of England re-emphasising its remit on maintaining low and stable inflation. The measures to help struggling households are likely to be the flagship policy in the budget, with Labour warning they need to be immediate to help people through the winter.\\nGrowth The chancellor says forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility show the economy will grow by 6.5% this year. Sunak says it will take until the start of 2022 for the economy to return to its pre-pandemic size. GDP will grow by 6% next year, 2.1% in 2023, 1.3% in 2024, 1.6% in 2025, and 1.7% in 2026. In March, the OBR had forecast growth of 4% this year, after a plunge of 9.9% in 2020 – the worst recession for 300 years. The OBR’s estimate for long-term scarring for the economy has been revised down from 3% to 2%. Unemployment is forecast to peak at 5.2% in the fourth quarter of 2021. In July 2020, the OBR had forecast unemployment would peak close to 12% by the end of that year due to the end of furlough. However, the scheme was extended until the end of September 2021. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: This is much better than expected, giving Sunak more room for manoeuvre on spending than he previously thought.\\nBorrowing Sunak says borrowing in the current financial year, 2021-22, will be 7.9% of GDP, and will fall to 3.3% next year. In cash terms, the OBR forecasts borrowing will be £183bn, and fall to £83bn in 2022-23 Borrowing in the last financial year, 2020-21, was estimated at £319bn, or 15.2% of GDP, the highest recorded level in peacetime. Debt levels will fall as a share of national income, from 98.2% in the current financial year to 88% by 2026-27 The chancellor says he is setting new “fiscal rules” for management of the public finances. Debt must fall as a percentage of GDP. In “normal times” the state should only borrow to invest in future growth, balancing everyday spending. This must happen by the third year of each forecast period. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: Fiscal rules seem to change almost annually these days, as new chancellors tweak their parameters to suit their aims and ideology. Sunak says he is on track to hit the new rules, which appears to be hardly surprising given that he has just devised them for himself. They will give him more flexibility on borrowing than the previous rules and contain caveats about only applying “in normal times”.\\nSpending review Sunak says there will be a real-terms rise for every government department. Departmental spending in this parliament will rise by £150bn, in the “largest increase this century”. Spending will grow in real terms by 3.8% a year. Sunak says: “If anybody still doubts it, today’s budget confirms it. The Conservatives are the real party of public services.” The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates average real-terms annual growth in departmental resource budgets was higher in previous years, above 4% in 2000 and 2002 under Labour, and 4.1% under the Conservatives in 2019. There will be grant funding for local government of £4.8bn, the “largest increase in core funding for over a decade”. Overseas aid will return to 0.7% of GDP by the end of the parliament, after a cut to 0.5% announced last year. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: The real-terms rise in budgets for government departments is more generous than expected, with the Institute for Fiscal Studies having previously warned that some could have been facing a squeeze. Part of this is likely to go on increases in spending on pay for public sector workers and to cover the rise in the national living wage. Education Sunak says funding for each pupil will be returned to 2010 levels, in an increase worth £1,500 a pupil. The government is tripling investment to create 30,000 special school places, he confirms. Total support for catchup funding because of the Covid pandemic will be almost £5bn. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: The extra money for schools is a new announcement that had not been trailed in the run-up to the budget. However, an increase in school funding to 2010 levels shows it has taken more than decade to return to previous levels after Tory austerity.\\nLevelling up Sunak announces £1.7bn of funding in the first grants from the Treasury’s Levelling Up Fund, for towns and cities including Stoke-on-Trent, Leeds, Doncaster and Leicester. The funding includes allocations to constituencies held by the Labour leadership, he indicates: “We’re so committed to levelling up we’re even levelling up the opposition front bench.” Libraries will be “renovated, restored and revived”. Tax relief on museums and galleries was due to be announced in March next year; it will be extended until March 2024. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: There is a clear message here from Sunak that he is opting for “investment” rather than “retrenchment” – or spending over austerity. The main aim of Johnson’s premiership is to retain the seats he won in the Midlands and north at the next election, with the “levelling-up” argument clearly aimed at this audience. Infrastructure and investment The chancellor says he will increase investment to support London-style transport across the regions of England. The government will invest £21bn on roads and £46bn on railways to improve journey times between cities. Sunak announces the government’s target for hitting research and development spending will reach £22bn by 2026-27, two years later than had been initially planned. The government will invest £20bn in R&D by 2024-25. Sunak says this stands as a “record investment to secure the UK’s future as a global science superpower”. Sunak announces he will limit tax relief for business R&D spending so that it only applies to domestic activities. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: Sunak is trumpeting billions of pounds more in investment spending. The small print will have to be examined to look at how much of this is new money but he does appear to have gone down the road of big capital spending with the aim of boosting growth. Experts also pointed out the timings mean a target on hitting science funding would not be met until two years later than planned. Employment and skills The chancellor says the government will raise government spending on skills and training by £3.8bn over the parliament, an increase of 42%. He confirms the government will launch a UK-wide numeracy service called Multiply. He says the programme will help 500,000 adults improve their numeracy. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: Skills is not a very voter-friendly topic but the government considers improving lifelong learning a key part of improving productivity. Much of this had been pre-briefed but the 43% increase in spending is nonetheless striking. Brexit Sunak says changes after Brexit will encourage British merchant shipping lines to fly red ensign flags. He jokes that this means “red flags are still flying somewhere in this country, even if they are all at sea”. Internal domestic flights will have air passenger duty cut. He says 9 million passengers will have their duty cut by half, “bringing people together across the UK”. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: This minor measure gives Sunak an opportunity for his first joke – not a very funny one – saying Labour will be pleased to see a red flag flying. The air passenger duty cut seems ill-judged in the run-up to the Cop26 climate change conference, as it will encourage people to take carbon-intensive short-haul flights rather than train journeys. Business taxes The chancellor confirms that the bank surcharge will be cut from 8% to 3%. Sunak says changes to business rates will be reformed to support companies, including a new 12-month relief for firms to invest in their premises. The chancellor says the investment incentives are worth £750m. Next year’s planned increase in the business rates multiplier will be cancelled. That is worth £4.6bn over the next five years, he says. Sunak announces a 50% business rates discount for companies in retail, hospitality and leisure sectors, up to a maximum of £110,000. It is a cut worth £1.7bn. The chancellor says: “This is the biggest single year tax cut to business rates in over 30 years.” Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: Tory MPs have been lobbying on this to support high street shops hit by the pandemic. Many small businesses will be pretty pleased with this and backbench Conservatives will be very happy to take this back to their constituents. Pubs and alcohol duty Sunak announces radical changes for alcohol duty, in what he calls the biggest changes for 140 years. The UK’s main duty rates on alcohol will be cut from 15 to six in a simplified system. Higher-strength alcoholic drinks will attract higher duties, including stronger red wines, fortified wines and high-strength ciders. Lower-strength drinks – such as rosé, fruit ciders and liqueurs – will attract a lower tax rate than currently. Pubs and bars will benefit from a new “draught relief” cutting duty on beer and cider sold in pubs by the most since 1923. The cost of a pint will be permanently cut by 3p. There will be a small brewers’ relief, including for cider makers. The chancellor says the reforms are taking advantage of leaving the EU to simplify the system. The chancellor says alcohol duties are “full of historical anomalies” as it dates back to 1643. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: There is a logic to these changes, punishing higher alcohol products and rewarding lower alcohol ones. However, it does little for non-drinkers and the overall measures are a revenue loser for the Treasury, meaning an overall cut to alcohol duty despite the negative impact of drinking on public health.\\nCost of living The chancellor says an increase in fuel duty will be cancelled, saving motorists £8bn over five years. After 12 years of freezing fuel duty it will save the average motorist £1,900. The chancellor confirms the national living wage will increase from £8.91 to £9.50 an hour from April. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: This is pitched as a measure to help struggling families. But cancelling a fuel duty increase is yet another measure that runs counter to the government’s narrative on tackling the climate emergency ahead of the Cop26 climate summit next week. Taxation and universal credit Sunak announces that he will cut the taper rate in universal credit from 63p to 55p. This will be worth more than £2bn. The work allowance will be increased by £500. The chancellor says this will be implemented no later than 1 December. It comes after the government cut universal credit by £20 a week from early October after a temporary uplift during the coronavirus pandemic, in a cut worth £6bn. Sunak says his “goal” is to reduce taxes by the end of the parliament. He says: “By the end of this parliament I want taxes to be going down, not up.” Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: Sunak is sounding most passionate as he throws some red meat to Tory backbenchers promising tax cuts in future. He goes on to announce reforms to the universal credit system that will enable those in work to keep more of what they own. It goes some way towards reversing the £20-a-week universal credit cut but only for those in work, not those out of work. It feeds in the Conservative narrative of encouraging employment but ignores the plight of some of those struggling the most. What Sunak didn’t mention The chancellor offered no direct support for soaring household energy bills after ruling out a cut in VAT for gas and electricity. Substantial green measures were missing from the budget, including carbon taxes and spending plans above and beyond details announced last week for reaching net zero. Business leaders had wanted more extensive reforms to business rates, including to support high street shops competing with online retailers. However, the Treasury merely said it would “explore the arguments for and against” an online sales tax. Sunak did not announce any decisions on HS2, or on high-speed rail across the north of England, known as HS3. The chancellor indicated he would cut taxes in the run-up to the next election, although did not spell out where he felt such changes were appropriate. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor: The lack of measures to help with energy bills was surprising given that this is going to be the biggest visible increase in household costs this winter, with rises over around 12%. There was no cut to VAT on energy bills – once promised by Brexiters – and not even any targeted increase to the warm homes discount for poorer households. This is a gamble, given the only other help for people struggling with their bills was a cut in alcohol duties and those lower paid on universal credit. The lack of big business tax reforms was perhaps a sign that Sunak has no appetite for any controversial shake-ups when he has so much else on his plate.   \n",



                                                                                                                                     It’s 2012 and I’m at Wimbledon chatting with Serena Williams. We’re recording an interview for BBC radio and she’s telling me about her new wristband which measures movement, heart rate, calories, even sleep quality. The technology is staggering. I find myself wondering if I should get one, despite the fact that only last week I bought myself a Garmin running watch that cost hundreds of pounds and offered many of the same features. I’m so absorbed by this conundrum, I realise that I’ve forgotten to listen to Serena, who stopped speaking several seconds ago and is now looking at me rather oddly. An increasingly awkward silence is filling the tiny interview room. I panic and accidentally ask her the same question again. How had I got here? To a point where I was ignoring the greatest female tennis player in the world to indulge my mania for running tech? Cycling, fishing, golf… certain sports come with a love of equipment as standard. But running is meant to be simpler, isn’t it? The purest form of exercise. Just lace up your shoes and get out there. When Pheidippides made that dash from Marathon to Athens, he probably wasn’t wearing compression tights. I only started running because I was plumping out in my mid-30s. I failed to reach the end of the street on my first-ever run – I set off too fast, paused for a wheeze outside a friend’s house, and ended up walking back home. But then I fell for it hard. I soon realised running was doing much more for me than just keeping the weight off. It gave me space – mental, emotional and physical. If I wanted to solve a nagging problem, I’d go for a run. If I was feeling tired, anxious, lethargic, I’d go for a run. The benefits were making themselves felt in every part of my life. I was soon doing it every day, often twice.\\nWithin a few years, I was cheerfully signing up for ultra marathons and triathlons (I once attempted one of each on the same weekend). I discovered I was living in a golden age of the runner. Back in the 80s, when people went out for a jog, all you needed was a tracksuit – accessorised, perhaps, with a headband and matching sweatbands. The only piece of tech you required was a Walkman to keep you moving to the beat of “Eye of the Tiger”. But now that “jogging” has transformed into the more serious pursuit of “running”, there was endless kit to be had. The tech crept into my life in increments. It started with the quest for the perfect pair of shoes. Then came the base layers – top and tights – that promised to be “injury reducing, temperature controlling and moisture managing”. Clearly these were completely vital. They were also £90 a pop, but hey – I’d get added value with each run. Next, socks. Another £40, but that’s money well spent when you consider that the ones I chose were “not only the result of tireless research work, they were also the subject of a doctoral thesis”.\\nMost weeks I’d emerge from a running shop armed with another must-have accessory. Sure, I was setting myself tougher and tougher running goals. But did I really need a hydration backpack to help me achieve them? Or hi-vis gloves and a £400 GPS watch? My transformation from “someone who went for a run” to “runner” was accompanied by the kind of monomania that characterises both Olympic athletes and middle-aged men in Lycra. My growing collection of running-related paraphernalia was fast becoming obscene. It’s a generally accepted truth that men love to feed our sporting hobbies with exorbitant, extravagant equipment: and we love to talk about our newest discoveries and acquisitions. As a sports reporter in regular encounters with professional athletes I suffered acutely. I think it was one of the Brownlee brothers – the world champion triathletes – who told me about sweat analysis and an isotonic drink which exactly replicates the minerals lost during exercise. I spent ages trying (and eventually failing) to find somewhere to create the same for me. But I did have my gait analysed in a lab in Oxford to check for minuscule deviations from the ideal which might lead to a niggle. As a result, my orthotics were custom made in Canada. And that Nike band Serena Williams talked about? I bought one, of course. After all, who doesn’t want to have something in common with Serena? You’d think all this gadgetry would be making my runs more enjoyable. But instead they were becoming more stressful. Dressed in my lurid gear, I’d stand in the middle of the road waiting for my watch to find a satellite signal. Even during a supposedly easy run, I’d check it every few minutes to discover how fast I was going – and all too frequently would end up berating myself mid-run. In the end, as I wandered around outside my front door scowling at London’s pesky, signal-obstructing buildings while impatiently waving my wrist at the clouds, I would be secretly dreading the hour or so that lay ahead of me.\\nAs for the races, every marathon became nothing more than a failure to achieve my ultimate goal – to finish in under three hours. Gone were the days when running 26.2 miles gave me any sense of achievement. It took me a while to work out that running stops being pleasurable – and stops being a release of tension, stops being an escape, an act of discovery and self-discovery – if you’re constantly stressing about how fast you’re travelling, what you’re wearing, what your heart rate is doing. Proper analysis is crucial for elite athletes. But I had lost the most elemental reason for my run – the sense of pleasure and diversion. Running can be simple and child-like and brilliant. The watch and the gear were keeping me away from that. They had to go. For a while they festered in the back of a cupboard. Then came a flash of endorphin-fuelled clarity after a fell run, and I bundled them all up and gave them to a local charity shop. Fast forward to a beautiful spring morning near Keswick, cresting the top of a fell and suddenly, unfolding into my gaze, the sublime radiance of the Lake District. All of England seemed to lie below, and I forgot about my aching thighs, sniffed the unpolluted air and enjoyed the sensation of soft earth under my feet. I realised, in that moment, there was nowhere else I’d rather be, and nothing else I’d rather be doing. I’m no expert, but isn’t that what they call mindfulness? I once interviewed a sports psychologist with a deeply impressive client list. He quoted Leonardo da Vinci: “Simplicity,” he told me. “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” Don’t Stop Me Now: 26.2 Tales of a Runner’s Obsession by Vassos Alexander (Bloomsbury, £12.99).

document passed to the Guardian. A confidential, draft document circulated to NHS North West London Collaboration of Clinical Commissioning Groups, which serves more than 2 million Londoners, admits the blueprint for one of the NHS’s largest planned reorganisations has failed. “NHS commissioners and providers in north-west London have therefore decided to draw the SaHF [Shaping a Healthier Future] programme to a conclusion,” the document states. The proposal was a flagship for reorganisation of the NHS in England when it was launched in 2012 and involved a reduction in the number of acute hospitals in eight London boroughs from nine to five. Julian Bell, the leader of Ealing council, described it as “a monstrous plan”. It was part of NHS strategy at the time to replace some acute hospitals with care provided in the community. The document states that £76m has been spent on management consultants for the failed scheme from 2010-11 until the end of 2018. It outlines how health officials can respond to difficult questions that may be asked about the failed scheme. It also discusses preparing people for new changes as part of the NHS’ long-term plan, which the document states will involve “difficult decisions and trade offs”. SaHF argued that four acute hospitals in – Hammersmith, Central Middlesex, Charing Cross and Ealing – could be downgraded. The proposal involved the loss of more than 600 acute hospital beds. The document reports there has been a reduction of just seven hospital beds in the last six years. The closure of Charing Cross was particularly controversial after plans were revealed to sell off 87% of the valuable central London site by the Guardian. But in March the health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced that plans to close A&E departments at Charing Cross and Ealing hospitals would no longer go ahead. The document says: “Continued growth in demand for acute care, despite investment in primary and community services, a growing underlying budget deficit and shortfalls in our ability to recruit and retain enough staff with the right skills’ means that the plan, as originally envisaged, is no longer viable.” It provides statistics about an increase of 227,288 in A&E attendances across north-west London since 2012 – a 4% rise per year, with a 2018-19 waiting list of 177,395 patients, which would require the provision of 95 extra beds for a year to clear the backlog. The document adds there has been a 40% increase in patients waiting for non-urgent surgery. It reveals how officials plan to “spin” this failure by citing improvements such as 100 new midwives and 90 new children’s nurses. In the document, under the heading “incorrect/sorry”, the question “Will anyone resign over this?” is posed and the answer provided is “no”. The response to the question “What have you learned from this and how will you change the way you make decisions in the future to ensure millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money isn’t wasted?” is “??”. The notion that some acute hospitals can be closed because NHS care can instead be provided in the community has been refuted in various independent studies including a report from the Nuffield Trust which dispels some of the myths around this “magic bullet”. Merril Hammer, secretary of Hammersmith & Fulham Save Our Hospitals, said: “The leaked paper is extraordinary. This was the biggest reorganisation project the NHS has ever seen. We still don’t know how much it has cost in total. Since the initial plans were drawn up, campaigners asked for the evidence that ‘out of hospital’ provision could reduce the need for acute hospital beds. This was never produced.” Cllr Ben Coleman, chair of Hammersmith and Fulham’s health and wellbeing board, said: “This leaked document confirms that SaHF was a grotesque waste of time and public money, which threatened life-saving health services.” A spokeswoman for NHS North West London Collaboration of CCGs said some of the spending on management consultants predated April 2013, when the CCGs were set up, so could not be verified. “North West London CCG’s spend on consultancies for the SaHF programme was £43m between April 2013 … and March 2019. There are now strict controls on management consultancy expenditure and we are not currently incurring consultancy costs for the development of our future plans, nor do we intend to.” She highlighted achievements of SaHF including the transformation of paediatric and maternity services in north-west London and an increase in children being treated without admission to a hospital ward. She added that while SaHF was no longer going forward and was being replaced with the NHS long-term plan, “we will however continue to learn and incorporate lessons from the previous programme into future work”.   \n",

Meal for two, including drinks and service: £60 In keeping with the current vogue on campus, this review comes with a trigger warning. At some point over the next 1,100 words, I believe I am going to come across as grossly patronising, sodden with metropolitan disdain and lousy with condescension. This, in turn, could trigger in many of you outbreaks of acute eye-rolling and sighing. To be fair, none of this is very different from usual. It’s just going to be more obvious this week. This is because I am overwhelmed by the impulse to tell you exactly what went through my head during the entire process of booking and eating at Maray in Liverpool, rather than dressing it up with some faux out-of-London friendly niceties to make myself sound better. This may not always be pretty.\\nThe fact is I never intended to review the place. I booked in because I had a show to do that night and, unlike most of the other restaurants in Liverpool, Maray was prepared to take a 9.30pm booking. (I whinged on Twitter about how hard it was to find somewhere to eat post 9pm outside London; I was met with the quite reasonable response from chefs that my struggle was as nothing compared to theirs to find enough customers willing to do so.) Their ability to take that booking – in my own name; as I say I wasn’t planning to write about it – even trumped my suspicion of the language used on the website. Because apparently they had not merely written their menu. They had “curated” the damn thing. Oh God. I’ve whinged about this before, but that’s not going to stop me doing so again. The word curate is not a synonym for “chosen” or “collected”. If it was, then in recent weeks I have curated the contents of my fridge, my underwear drawer and my prejudices. It must be infuriating to all the genuine curators in museums the world over, pursuing their calling with dedication and experience, that every half-arsed cocktail jockey, stove monkey or DJ has co-opted the term to make their jobs sound better. I suppose saying you curate contemporary sounds for an athletic body movement-aware demimonde does sound a bit better than: “I put on records in a nightclub.”\\nExcept, having eaten at Maray, I am willing to acknowledge that there is something akin to curation going on here. They have curated a load of the best stuff currently omnipresent in London, and brought it here. The restaurant’s name is apparently a phonetic realisation of the Marais district of Paris. There, in the tight knot of streets just behind the Bastille, long one of the city’s Jewish areas, the three young founders were much taken by the falafel joints. They wanted to bring something of that back to Liverpool. And the falafel at Maray, apparently made from scratch every day rather than with chickpea flour, is a marvellous thing: crisp outside, puffing a sweet nuttiness from inside as you break them open. They come with a smear of hummus punched up with the fire of harissa and, for ballast, a little tabbouleh. Flatbreads are delivered to the table soft and warm. But what’s really interesting is the rest of the menu. This is a small plates, sharing portions gaff, the sort of thing you can’t move for in Dalston and Peckham. What’s extremely clever, however, is that it manages to cover seemingly every genre going. So, while the flavours of the Middle Eastern grill house do predominate, it’s also a bit Skandi and a bit pimped American junk food. It is all the clichés that we have become very used to in the capital across multiple restaurants, only crammed into one. In the hands of a lesser kitchen this could be a car crash, complete with tyre marks, collapsed lamp posts and distraught witnesses; a cacophony of plates, each of which is a fumble of the genuine article. But Maray does all of these things very well indeed, and at an exceptionally good price. Most dishes cost £6 or a little less.\\nFrom the Middle Eastern end of the menu comes a lump of roasted cauliflower with high smoky notes, dressed with tahini, yogurt, more harissa, flaked almonds and the sweet burst of pomegranate seeds. The much-lauded Palomar in London’s Soho does this. Maray does it equally well, but much cheaper. From the same side of the menu comes thumb-thick pieces of butternut squash, roasted until caramelised and soft, and dressed with cooling tahini and the sweet-sour punch of a sticky balsamic reduction. Planks of seared wild mushroom come on a buttery purée of the same and dressed with the aromatics of dukkah, until they smell like an old spice shop in a Turkish bazaar.\\nNext up something from northern latitudes, bringing a lightness to the darker flavours of the Middle East: pristine cubes of beetroot and gin-cured trout, with the crunch of pickled cucumber, which reminds me of the food at Rök a couple of weeks back. Non-meat dishes predominate here – Monday’s are completely meat free – but from the short list we get their buttermilk fried chicken, made with thigh meat as it should be, and drizzled with a spiced honey. God, but it’s good: crispy, salty and sweet. So that’s a nod to Spuntino or Rita’s. Heads of kale are deep fried and dressed with salt and chilli. They crumble and puff to nothing in our mouths and are completely addictive.\\nThere are just two desserts including a plum and pear cheesecake which we are told is “deconstructed”. That’s the kind of thing which could make me a bit punchy and shouty. Couldn’t you just make a real one? But I rather like the bowl of whipped sweetened cream with a fruit purée and a kind of biscuit gravel. It’s not a cheesecake and has no hope of ever being one, but it’s extremely edible. The room is long and narrow and has distressed brickwork on one side and white walls the other, hung with edgy pop art. The tables are made from reclaimed doors and sewing machine stands. The kitchen is half open and staffed by a bearded man. Some of the wines are biodynamic. Well, of course they are. But that’s OK. Liverpool’s restaurant sector is expanding. Interesting things are happening. But, right now, it’s unlikely it could support three small sharing-plate joints covering, say, the Middle East, Scandinavia and the US. Happily, it doesn’t need to. Because down on Bold Street there’s a place called Maray. And it’s doing the job just fine. Jay’s news bites ■ The Palomar, at the unsexy end of London’s Rupert Street, has managed the rare trick of creating a vibe without letting it overwhelm the food. Sit at the bar, back chat with the chefs, drink shots and enjoy the Israeli-influenced food, such as the Jerusalem mix of chicken livers, hearts and veal sweetbreads seared with okra, tomato and tahini (thepalomar.co.uk). ■ Given the excitement around steaks from long-lived Spanish dairy cows, it was only time before a British equivalent emerged. Butcher Salter & King of Aldeburgh, Suffolk is selling meat from a 12-year-old Lincoln Red. ‘The colour is dark and intense,’ says Gerard King, ‘and the yellow fat runs lightly right through the meat.’ They deliver nationwide (salterandking.co.uk). ■ Ping Coombes, who won MasterChef in 2014, has surfaced in her first restaurant role. She is consulting on the menu at Chi Kitchen, located in Debenhams on London’s Oxford Street. It will finally make her famed laksa available to the public (chikitchen.co.uk).

He can’t tell me which one, of course. He’s speaking statistically, not to me direct, in a comment piece he published to justify the remarks he made on Studio 10 earlier this week. In the show Hildebrand was in a conversation with activist Phil Cleary, held in the wake of another brutal alleged murder of a woman, Courtney Herron. Victoria Assistant Police Commissioner Luke Cornelius has said “violence against women is absolutely about men’s behaviour”. Cleary – whose own sister was murdered by a man in 1987 – urged the need for men to collectively address the sexism of pervasive cultural traditions. The overwhelming narrative of the culture we’ve inherited still positions women as expendable objects, deserving of lesser status while defining “masculinity” as a capacity for physical force and brutality. The moral obligation of men who didn’t want women to be murdered, argued Cleary, was “to explain to men everywhere how we’ve got to revisit our relationship to women and the position of women in society”. Hildebrand took umbrage. “I don’t really understand where this is coming from,” he said. “There is nothing dark in my heart.” “I didn’t say in your heart,” responded Cleary, in a conversation that was supposed to be about the murder of a woman in the context of a culture that deprioritises women and which lasted precisely 4.23 seconds before it was suddenly about Joe Hildebrand. It was the perfect demonstration of what has long been known on the internet – yes, for nearly a decade – as the “not all men” meme. When Vox was writing about when men “remind the speaker that ‘not all men’ do something, they derail what could be a productive conversation … and that little qualifier … recentres their feelings as the central part of the dialogue” it was in 2014, not actually this week. Hildebrand went on to refer to himself 43 times in the subsequent five minutes of discussion.\\nOn both the issue and the personalisation, he has doubled down. “I was asked what I thought about Victoria police’s comments,” he began, “I thought it was a really nonsensical thing to say.” Only one in 23,000 men are murderers, he said, so “is mass reflection of this really going to stop that one man from killing?” The police, advocacy organisations and the recommendations of a royal commission suggest, well, yes. They have decades of research to draw on, like that mentioned here, here, here, here, here and here. The persistency of unequal gender roles are overwhelmingly the conditioning factor for gender-based violence. Either we can truthfully have the conversation about how we work together to transform the social understanding of those gender roles or – do what, exactly? We all just have to live with the fact that every community in Australia with 23,000 men in it – from a Twitter follower count to a Facebook page, a football club to a country town – contains a murderer? Research be damned, let’s not do anything about it? Let’s allow more than 100 male murderers to wander Sydney alone … before, of course, we add to their number the rapists, the bashers, the abusers, the thousands and thousands of men at the end of #MeToo allegations, the criminals who don’t even register in the crime statistics because women maintain some strange notion that people don’t take crimes against them seriously. “People still commit murder” despite powerful disincentives, writes someone who probably by now should have heard of an “anti-terrorism initiative”. But, pfft, whatever, don’t get het up about this dead women stuff. Roll with what life gives you, folks. Chillax. There is something more precise to be identified from these events than is covered just by their inclusion in the #NotAllMen discourse. This what I would call the Masculine Insistence Paradox – a man passionately refuses to share responsibility for the perpetration of sexist narratives and dangerous gender roles and by doing so affirms both. “I don’t see how me reflecting on myself is going to stop women being bashed or murdered,” the man said. No, you don’t, Joe. And – I really hate to say it – but maybe that’s something we should all discuss. Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnist   \n",

shown the door at the Nou Camp, in a state of affairs that is believed to be one of many reasons behind his best pal Leo Messi’s decision to hand in a transfer request, Manchester City striker Gabriel Jesus has been identified as a potential replacement by Barcelona for the Uruguayan striker. Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain are both reported to be interested in signing Messi, although Manchester City are reported to be in the box-seat with one tabloid reporting the player’s father is already in talks with the club. In the increasingly likely event of Messi’s departure from the club he has served for 20 years, it remains to be seen who will be given the unenviable and frankly impossible task of filling his Adidas Nemeziz 19.1s. By his own lofty standards N’Golo Kanté had a fairly underwhelming season punctuated by injury at Chelsea but that hasn’t put off Internazionale, whose policy of rehoming Premier League stars has enjoyed more than a modicum of success. The Serie A side need to offload another high profile player before they can bring him in and Lautaro Martinez, Milan Skriniar and Marcelo Brozovic are among those they would consider letting go to help fund the deal.\\nHighly regarded QPR midfielder Eberechi Eze looks set to leave Loftus Road for pastures new, specifically the lush green rectangle of grass at Selhurst Park. Sky Sports News have reported the Crystal Palace have agreed a fee of £16m rising to £20m, with the Championships side insisting on a 20% sell-on clause that could yield them a pretty penny in years to come. Wolves full-back Matt Doherty is also on the move to Tottenham after 10 years of faithful service at Molineux. A fee of £15m has been agreed and Doherty’s former League of Ireland club Bohemians – for whom he never actually made a senior appearance – are in line for a bumper pay-day on the back of a clause they shrewdly included in the transfer deal between themselves and Wolves a decade ago.\\nResigned to losing Doherty, Wolves are in search of a replacement and have identified Arsenal’s Ainsley Maitland-Niles as the man for the job. An initial bid of £15m for the 22-year-old has been rejected, with the Emirates beancounters confident they can hold out for a few quid more. Celtic’s already slim chances of holding on to Odsonne Édouard suffered a major blow following their meek exit from the Champions League at the hands of Hungarian side Ferencvaros. The striker missed last night’s humiliation at Celtic Park, apparently through injury, but has been heavily linked with a move to Aston Villa. Crystal Palace, Leicester City and Arsenal are also reported to be keen. Following Celtic’s earliest elimination from the competition in 15 years, manager Neil Lennon some of his players were distracted by interest from other clubs. “Get your mentality right, get your attitude right,” he said. “If some of you don’t want to be here, leave. Let us work with players who want to be here.” Ouch.   \n",

fundamentally flawed and needs to be rewritten in several ways, peers have said, as the House of Lords prepares to debate the legislation this week. The Lords constitution committee said that the bill as it currently stands risked “undermining legal certainty” and should be substantially changed, even though it has already been voted through the House of Commons. The bill will be subject to fierce debate when it reaches the Lords on Tuesday and Wednesday, with remain-supporting peers expected to vote for a motion of regret that the public is not getting another say over Brexit. Ahead of that battle, the committee recommended major changes that could be debated at a later stage of the bill’s passage through the second chamber. The purpose of the legislation is to transpose EU legislation into domestic law in time for Brexit day at the end of March 2019. But the committee said the task was complicated not only by its “scale and complexity”, but problems with the drafting. “We conclude that the bill risks fundamentally undermining legal certainty in a number of ways,” the cross-party group said. The peers said the method proposed to create a new category of “retained EU law” would cause “problematic uncertainties and ambiguities”. They also criticised the elements of the bill granting ministers power to amend regulations without full parliamentary scrutiny, known as Henry VIII powers, saying they are “overly broad” and there is an “unacceptably wide” emergency procedure for short-term changes. Thirdly, the peers warned that failure to secure agreement from the Scottish and Welsh administrations about the devolution of powers returned from Brussels could have “significant constitutional repercussions”. “The bill is therefore fundamentally flawed from a constitutional perspective in multiple ways,” the report said. Lady Taylor of Bolton, the chair of the committee, said: “We acknowledge the scale, challenge and unprecedented nature of the task of converting existing EU law into UK law, but as it stands, this bill is constitutionally unacceptable.” All the aspects of the bill criticised by the peers have already been challenged in the Commons, but ultimately, the government was only defeated on one issue, as MPs insisted they wanted a guaranteed vote on the terms of leaving before Brexit. Peers will have to decide how far they want to go towards challenging the bill when amendments are debated at committee and report stage in the coming weeks. Labour is planning to support around 20 amendments in the Lords, meaning there is a real chance of government defeats with the support of crossbench and Lib Dem peers. Top of its list of demands are: a role for parliament in the event of no deal; a vote for the UK parliament on the final deal ahead of the EU parliament; a time-limited transitional period on current terms; enhanced protection for EU-derived rights; further limitations on Henry VIII powers; and removing the government’s fixed Brexit day. Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the Lords, who will open the second reading debate for Labour said: “We will work with others around the Lords to change this bill so it becomes an enabling measure for, rather than an obstacle to a transitional period, as is currently the case. This will include seeking amendments relating to ‘exit day’, ensuring the government cannot reduce rights via secondary legislation, and providing greater clarity about the role of the European court of justice and the future status of its case law. “Labour has consistently called for a transitional period based on current terms, including a temporary extension to our participation in the single market and customs union. This would prevent a cliff edge for consumers and businesses in March 2019.”   \n",

                        There are now more Romanians living in the UK than there are Irish nationals or Indians, official figures reveal. Romania has overtaken the Republic of Ireland and India to move from fourth to second most-common non-British nationality in the UK, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) found. The number of Romanian nationals living in the UK in 2017 was estimated to be 411,000 – a jump of 25% on the previous year, and the largest increase for any country.\\nRomania joined the European Union in 2007 but it was only in 2014 that restrictions on Romanians’ rights to work in the UK were lifted. Polish remains the most common non-British nationality, with an estimated 1 million in the UK. The UK government has reached an agreement with the EU on citizens’ rights in negotiations on Britain’s withdrawal from the EU. People who, by 31 December 2020, have been continuously and “lawfully living” in the UK for five years will be able to apply to stay indefinitely by acquiring settled status. Those who will have been living here for less than five continuous years by that date will be able to apply to stay until they have reached that five-year threshold. Then they too can also apply for settled status. Nicola White, of the ONS migration statistics division, said: “Non-UK born and non-British populations continued to increase in 2017, as more people continued to come to the UK to live than move to live abroad for a year or more. “Poland-born residents and Polish nationals were the most common populations from outside the UK. However, the largest increases in population were seen from those born in Romania and those with Romanian nationality.”\\nAbout 350,000 Irish nationals lived in the UK in 2017, while there were 346,000 Indians. The figures show the total number of non-British nationals living in the UK in 2017 was 6.2 million, up 4% on 2016’s total of 6 million. This is a smaller rise than that recorded between 2015 and 2016, when the number rose by 8%. The figures show that 3.8 million (61%) of the 6.2 million non-British nationals living in the UK in 2017 held EU nationality. This is roughly the same proportion as 2016 (60%). London had the largest proportion of non-British nationals in 2017, with the highest numbers in the local authorities of Newham (38%), Westminster (36%) and Brent (34%). The ONS data is based on a survey of households and does not include most people living in communal establishments, some NHS accommodation, or students living in halls of residence who have non-UK resident parents.   \n",

mercifully) away from Trumpland and towards Cuba, where the one-time revolutionary Fidel Castro died aged 90. In this week’s Guardian Weekly our news pages examines what Castro’s passing means for Cuba’s thawing relations with the US and the rest of the world, a leader column considers his place in history, while on the Opinion pages Zoe Williams reminds us of the dangers of eulogising deceased dictators from either side of the political spectrum. That’s all inside the edition. Our cover story this week turns to environmental big thinking, and the quest to harness clean, limitless energy from nuclear fusion. The Guardian’s head of environment Damian Carrington reports from southern France and the site of a massive new internationally funded reactor complex, where it is hoped an ambition that has eluded atomic scientists for 60 years can be brought to fruition within the next few decades. We know Weekly readers care passionately about energy and the environment, so we look forward to hearing your thoughts on this one. Is fusion the answer to the world’s energy problems, or are renewables the way forward? Write to our Reply page and let us know! France was in the news for other matters this week, as the conservative François Fillon won the centre-right presidential primary election. Will the man they call the “French Thatcher” defeat the Front National’s Marine Le Pen in next year’s presidential election proper – and if so, what can France expect? In Syria, a rapid advance by pro-Assad forces appears to have struck a decisive blow in the battle for Aleppo. In northern Nigeria, the disruption of food production by Islamist extremists is threatening to cause a humanitarian disaster. From Pakistan, Le Monde reports on the growing presence and influence of Islamic State as it is squeezed out of its heartlands. Let’s not forget the US, of course, where Donald Trump’s apparent readiness to change his stance from one meeting to the next has left both supporters and opponents confused. From New York, David Smith attempts to make sense of it all. In the UK, allegations of child abuse focused on youth football coaching programmes stretching back decades are threatening to engulf the national game. We also catch up with chancellor Phillip Hammond’s autumn economic statement, and what it means for the country. The Weekly Review gets stuck into some exciting scientific efforts to apply nature’s intelligent design to modern medicine. From Montreal, we hear of an interesting scheme to limit suburban restaurants as a way of controlling gentrification. The Books pages review Zadie Smith’s new millennial coming-of-age novel, and also profile the bestselling Spanish-language author Corin Tellado, whose extensive body of romantic fiction reveals many insights into Spanish society. Culture meets Albania’s prime minister Edi Rama, a talented artist as well as a politician, and finds out why Newark, New Jersey, is becoming a leading destination in the jazz music world. We’re moving rapidly towards the Christmas holiday season here in the UK and so our attention is turning to the Guardian Weekly’s year-ending double edition, which will be with you later this month. I don’t want to give too much away at the moment, but I will say that we’re definitely going to need those extra pages … Thanks for reading and do let us know your thoughts on the edition.

                                                                                      Communities across the US are using federal stimulus money to bring grocery stores and healthy food to food deserts, as the pandemic and rising costs put nutrition further out of reach for many. The regions using American Rescue Plan funds include Montana’s Fort Belknap Indian Reservation, a 1,000-sq-mile expanse shared by the Assiniboine and Gros Ventre tribes. Most of the reservation is considered a food desert by the US Department of Agriculture, meaning most residents have little access to healthy food. An Indigenous-owned company on the reservation plans to renovate and expand the Little River Trading Post, formerly part of the Kwik Stop chain, in the town of Fort Belknap Agency.\\nThe combination gas station and convenience store closed briefly after it was bought and then reopened in December selling apples, bananas, potatoes, onions and berries. “Our berries fly off the shelves,” said Eddie Moore, a business development officer who runs the store for the Island Mountain Development Group, which bought the business last year. It plans to use federal stimulus funds to expand its fresh produce offering this year. At least five other communities have proposed using money from the American Rescue Plan – the $1.9tn package approved by Congress in 2021 to help the country recover from the pandemic’s effects – to open or revive grocery stores, according to the US Treasury Department. A slew of other areas are looking at ways the funds could ease food insecurity. In Toledo, Ohio, local activists have urged the city to use $1m of the federal infrastructure funds to help attract a grocery store to a low-income neighborhood. Healthier food would help alleviate high obesity, cholesterol and blood pressure problems among Toledo’s Black population, said the Rev Donald Perryman, president of the Toledo advocacy group United Pastors for Social Empowerment. “When you have been an oppressed resident of our country in some of these disadvantaged neighborhoods, you develop some habits related to survival,” he said. “Sometimes those habits become embedded.” Black and Latinos are more likely to live in areas without grocery stores than white people, as are low-income people. The grocery model is broken and the federal funding offers new ways to fix it, said Beverley Wheeler, director of DC Hunger Solutions, which runs nutrition programs in the nation’s capital. “Our large grocery stores have a business model that’s built on education and income,” said Wheeler, who noted Washington DC plans to use American Rescue Plan funds to add smaller grocery stores to underserved neighborhoods this year. “They don’t build them in the neighborhoods where we need them.” It can be hard for a grocery store to make a profit even in affluent communities, so getting companies to stick around low-income neighborhoods is a challenge, said Connie Max, executive vice-president for lending with the Local Initiatives Support Corp, a non-profit that helps fund community projects. More communities are asking for help attracting or retaining grocers, Max said, with local governments and community non-profits gathering funds rather than waiting for companies to open stores on their own. “The margins are pretty thin on grocery stores,” she said. “Whenever we can, we try to help them to purchase the facility to really root them in the community.” But giving residents access to healthy food may not be as simple as opening a new grocery store.\\nToledo officials are trying to figure out what would help the most, especially in neighborhoods that have lost population. Less than half the population gets its groceries from grocery stores, said Sandy Spang, the city’s deputy economic development director, down from 90% in 1988. The city is surveying residents to see whether new grocery stores would be more useful than, say, food trucks or other prepared food options. “I think we need to recognize the distribution of food is changing,” Spang said. “I don’t think we can look at the solutions of 40 years ago. If you’ve lost density in neighborhoods, you’re not necessarily going to have feasibility for traditional grocery stores.” In Birmingham, Alabama, which is also researching ways to use ARP funds for healthier food options, the city paid to renovate an abandoned grocery store but realized it would need to divide the building in half to attract a new grocer because companies tend to prefer smaller stores. Residents surrounded by convenience and dollar stores have sorely missed having access to fresh foods such as produce, baked goods and seafood, said Carol Clarke, the city councilor who represents the neighborhood. “It is most assuredly a food desert,” she said. Other communities are also using ARP funds to ease food insecurity: The Cherokee Nation hopes to open a grocery store in Marble City, Oklahoma. “It’s important to ensure our Cherokee communities inside the reservation have access to healthy foods, especially in our rural areas where there are limited resources including grocery stores,” said Chuck Hoskin Jr, Cherokee Nation principal chief. Austin, Texas, where 12 of the city’s zip codes lack grocery stores, plans to open at least one pilot store in underserved eastern Austin. Macon-Bibb county, Georgia, is spending $1m on a grocery store in a low-income neighborhood. Memphis, Tennessee, and Washington DC, also plan to open ARP-funded stores, and Charleston, West Virginia, has proposed Miss Ruby’s Corner Market, which would take over the site of a former soda fountain near a senior housing complex where residents have trouble getting to grocery stores further away. The non-profit store will carry local produce and offer nutrition education, said Spencer Moss, executive director of the West Virginia Food & Farm Coalition, which is helping to open the business. “We don’t need to make a profit,” she said. “We just need to break even.”   \n",

                                                                In a world as complex as ours, slogans are more important than they have any right to be. When questions of how to organise society, distribute resources and conduct relations with our neighbours fox even the greatest of experts, it’s human nature to run for the shelter of an easy explanation. The shorthands we use to skip over messy realities – “budget responsibility”, “war on terror”, “migrant crisis” – shape our understanding of them, for good or ill. They are what linguist Geoffrey Leech once described as “concept forming”. That means that, in any contentious debate, getting in there early with a pithy phrase is half the battle.\\nWhen it comes to Brexit, the most intricate political problem Britain has faced for decades, it’s clear who’s been winning the war. “Take back control” was a stroke of genius, boiling down the problem of how to improve lives in an interdependent world to a simple question of self-determination. “No deal is better than a bad deal” was good too: despite the fact that leaving the EU without any kind of agreement represents the worst outcome of all, it recast the government’s weakness as defiance. And now we have the “Brexit dividend”, the fiscal bounty that leaving the world’s largest trading bloc will apparently deliver. It’s a phrase you’ll have read a lot in the past day or two. As “allies of the foreign secretary” briefed that he was to demand an extra £5bn for the NHS in cabinet this week, it kept cropping up – sometimes with and sometimes without inverted commas, depending on the level of scepticism applied. Johnson “will not relent on demands for a £100m a week Brexit dividend until it is secured”, wrote the Times. His Brexit brother-in-arms Liam Fox backed him up. “I think it’s very useful to remind people that we will get a dividend from leaving the EU,” he told the BBC. Maybe they were taking their cue from Jacob Rees-Mogg, who told the Sun on Sunday: “Brexit is a great opportunity for the UK to build a new independent trade policy that delivers jobs, cheaper food and clothing — an immediate Brexit dividend for the British people.”\\nPerhaps they’re ultimately inspired by “peace dividend”, a phrase first used in 1969 to describe the money that would no longer have to be spent on the Vietnam war if it were brought to an end, and used much more widely at the end of the cold war. In any case, it’s a clever formulation: it’s neat, catchy, and appears to sum up the possibilities of the post-Brexit era. The contribution the UK currently makes to the EU budget will soon be ours to spend however we see fit. But it’s a blatant lie. There is no “Brexit dividend”, because the net effect of Brexit is to cost the UK money. As the FT set out in excruciating detail before Christmas, leaving the EU doesn’t come cheap. Forget the “Brexit divorce settlement”, the forty-odd billion that covers existing budget commitments and some other costs such as pensions. We haven’t even left yet, but the uncertainty has already zapped 1.3% of GDP, according to estimates – the equivalent of £340m per week. And before you counter that this is still less than the fabled £350m a week that was plastered on campaign buses during the referendum, remember that that figure, too, was a lie. The rough cost per week of EU membership adds up to more like £136m – some of which funds regulatory agencies we benefit from and will have to replicate after we leave. So the phrase “Brexit dividend” should definitely come with flashing lights and sirens, and at the very least inverted commas. But I fear it’s too late. The concept already has currency, and may be unstoppable. It’s incumbent on those who see it for what it is to point this out at every opportunity, and perhaps come up with a reality-based version. Reality, in this case, may be too depressing, too unglamorous a rival. But at least “Brexit burden” or “Brexit penalty” have the ring of truth.   \n",

justice, migrant rights or attempts to reappraise Britain’s account of its colonial history” (The culture war isn’t harmless rhetoric, it’s having a chilling effect on equality, 22 February). But because she is on the right side of history, she apparently fails to see that the choice of words that the Black Lives Matter movement uses to frame its funding requirement, ie “to improve black people’s lives in a racist society”, actually leaves those millions of people who were educated in the belief that empire was good with nowhere to go: if it is a racist society and I am not on the right side of history, then I am a racist. If we are to avoid our fellow citizens falling into the hands of rightwing extremists then, without detracting from the social justice imperative, we need to embrace a vocabulary and dialogue that is more nuanced and which gives people on the wrong side of history the opportunity to reflect on their cultural preconceptions and prejudices in a climate that is less febrile and accusatory. Christopher Coppock Cardiff • Nesrine Malik’s article reminds me of another occasion when the government launched a targeted attack on critics to obscure the impacts of its disastrous social policies. Back in the 1980s, the National Association of Citizens’ Advice Bureaux (NACAB) collected information from its local bureaux about a wide range of issues and published the data in the form of short briefing papers. The cumulative effect of these papers in the area of social security showed how cuts in benefits were generating hugely increased poverty among most population groups. Thatcher’s government argued that NACAB should not be engaging in politics, and threatened to withdraw NACAB’s core funding, which would have led to its closure. NACAB, supported by a wide-ranging protest, and with legal advice, resisted the threat, which was later ruled unlawful. Fortunately, Black Lives Matter UK does not rely on government funding, but civil society has to ensure that through it and other channels, the fight continues to resist the government’s attempt to obscure its increasingly racist policies, actions and threats.

are discovering why Old Enough, a show that makes stars of children as young as two, has enjoyed such enduring popularity. Described by the Guardian’s Stuart Heritage as “an absolute rollercoaster of emotions that leaves you in tatters”, the programme follows a simple, crowd-pleasing format. Children aged between two and five are sent out alone on their first errand by their nervous parents. As they negotiate roads and public transport, camera crew disguised as passersby capture every emotional portion of their journey, from the tearful frustration of getting lost to the elation of returning to their relieved parents, errand completed.\\nThe tasks set in the programme reflect errands Japanese children carry out in real life, although for every rural family happy to send their four-year-old to the corner shop is another in Tokyo that would shudder at the thought of exposing their offspring to the potential dangers of busy urban streets. In one episode, Hiroki, a two-year-old boy, navigates traffic on a 20-minute journey to the shop to buy flowers, curry and fishcakes for his mother. In another, Hinako, who is just shy of five, is tasked with giving a handmade hara-obi or traditional maternity belt to a pregnant neighbour before buying wakame, an edible seaweed, and picking onions and cabbage from the family allotment. During an errand to the local market, three-year-old Yuka buys udon noodles and tempura, but returns with sea bream instead of the prawns her mother had requested. All is quickly forgiven. The show’s creator, Junji Ouchi, says the show continues to draw in audiences because it centres on a treasured feature of Japanese family life. Still the programme’s executive director, he said he was inspired by the widely accepted practice among Japanese parents of asking their children to run errands alone. “I thought, what if we film a child when they’re sent on their very first errand, without them being aware of what we’re doing?” he says. “Perhaps we might find something in the footage that’s worthy of television. “Family situations have changed drastically over the 30-plus years since we started this … but the tradition of sending children on errands remains. Our hope is to document that tradition before it gradually disappears.” What viewers don’t see are the errands that don’t work out, although Ouchi says he prefers not to describe them as failures. “We started conducting simulations and learned that for every 10 errands we shoot, about one will be television material. To this day, we just focus on recording those first errand moments and one out of every six to 10 gets aired.” The Nippon TV series, a staple of Japanese television since it first aired as Hajimete no Otsukai or My First Errand in 1991, has acquired a cast of thousands of families. Its success in Japan, where it still attracts huge audiences, is proof that the warning to never work with children or animals may only be half right. The format has been untouched for 30 years, but each series captures subtle changes in Japanese society and family dynamics. Old Enough first appeared as Japan’s asset-inflated “bubble economy” was about to make way for decades of stagnation, and just as the country started to grapple with rural depopulation and the erosion of the traditional family unit, with several generations living under the same roof. “By filming the children on their first errands, we are documenting an aspect of contemporary Japan at any given point in time,” Ouchi says. “That is a major theme of the show, and we believe it is one of the reasons that throughout its long history, it has won the support of viewers across all generations. The children are the undisputed stars of the show, thanks both to their successes and their capacity for the unpredictable – a wrong turn, an impromptu conversation or an overly ponderous visit to the shops. “Even children we expect to come home quickly start doing something else that we find astonishing,” Ouchi says. “Sometimes their errand ends up taking quite a long time. “We’ve been doing this for decades, but there hasn’t been one errand that looked the same as any of the others. Perhaps that’s how we’ve managed to keep making the show for so long without viewers growing weary of it.” The international success of Old Enough has inevitably generated a debate about whether its premise would work in other countries, particularly in the west, where the world beyond the front door can seem fraught with danger. The third series of the Singapore-based version will be produced soon, and Nippon TV says it is considering many offers to make adaptations in other countries. Some social media users have questioned the ethics of sending toddlers out into the unknown, albeit tracked by camera crews and staff along the way. The show’s producer, Naoko Yano, says the families are willing participants in a documentary, not contestants in an exploitative TV reality show. “We select families that are planning to ask their child to run their first errand anyway, regardless of whether they will get filmed or not,” she says. “We try to find families who will allow us to record their stories. “It is the families that decide what errand they want their child to run. We don’t tell them what to do. We actually share stories of failures that happened throughout the years and offer advice on how to get their child to feel motivated about their task.” The producers’ relationship with the families continues long after their appearance, mainly via new year’s greetings cards and letters. Some write to share family milestones, when their child starts a new school or gets married.\\nOne viewer who had appeared on the show as a child even contacted the network to film their own child running an errand. Ouchi believes the benign version of tough love dispensed on Old Enough gives children too young to tie their shoelaces an opportunity to exhibit astonishing levels of autonomy and enterprise. “All we really want is for the child to have an amazing day full of memories they will cherish for the rest of their lives,” he says. “Sometimes adults have to play the bad guy to encourage a child to become independent. So, when grownups help a child out of kindness, could it be because they don’t see them as equals? We try to make sure the children don’t feel like they’re still being treated like babies.”   \n",

punishment for what the club themselves described as antisemitic chanting by their fans at a Europa League game in Hungary after Uefa closed the disciplinary proceedings. There was no explanation from European football’s governing body, which had charged Chelsea with racist behaviour by supporters at December’s match against Vidi, but it is believed it reached the decision because it could not gather enough evidence.\\nAfter the Europa League game Chelsea publicly condemned a small section of their travelling support for an anti-Tottenham Hotspur chant which referenced “Yids”. They said the chant, heard in the opening three minutes of the game, “shamed the club” and they questioned “the brainpower” of those responsible. Chelsea faced a partial closure of Stamford Bridge in European competition if found guilty. A Uefa statement said: “The CEDB [control, ethics and disciplinary body] has decided to close the disciplinary proceedings against Chelsea FC.” Real Madrid’s Sergio Ramos has been suspended for an extra European match after Uefa found him guilty of “clearly receiving a yellow card on purpose” and will miss two games in total. Ramos was booked in the 89th minute of Madrid’s 2-1 win at Ajax. Immediately after the match he was quoted as saying he “would be lying” if he were to deny deliberately earning the caution, which meant he could serve a ban in the return leg of the last-16 tie and start with a clean disciplinary slate in any quarter-final. Later he used social media to claim he had not intentionally collected a yellow card but was referring to purposely giving away a free-kick to prevent an Ajax equaliser. Uefa has fined Manchester United €16,000 (£13,700) over the throwing of objects and blocked stairways in the Champions League game at home to Paris Saint-Germain. The French club have been fined €41,000 for their fans’ behaviour at Old Trafford and ordered to compensate United for damage caused to the segregation net and seats.   \n",

child for the climate emergency, Miami Beach has become a world leader in mitigating the effects of sea-level rise. Now the subtropical Florida city is cutting back on its famous swaying palm trees as it seeks shadier alternatives to preserve its environment and try to keep residents and visitors cool.\\nOfficials have embarked on a 30-year plan to reduce the percentage of palm trees in the city to only one quarter of its total canopy by 2050, according to the Miami Herald. Currently, Arecaceae palms account for more than 55% of the city’s population of 48,900 trees. The cutback is needed, the newspaper says, to reduce urban warming and improve air quality, and about 1,000 palm trees will be removed in the coming weeks as part of already scheduled construction projects. But Elizabeth Wheaton, the environmental and sustainability director for Miami Beach, said there was no plan for any mass chopping down of palms, which have been a staple of postcards and travel brochures depicting Miami for generations. Instead, the percentage reduction will be largely achieved by planting about 1,300 new shade trees instead of palms over the next two decades, which she said would make the city “more walkable and pleasant.” “Expanding shade canopy will enhance the city’s brand and quality of life,” Wheaton wrote in an email to the Herald. “Palms will continue to be a focal point along the city’s roads, green spaces and parks.” According to the urban forestry master plan that forms part of Miami Beach’s Rising Above initiative to combat the climate crisis, about 17 percent of the city’s 15.2 sq-mile footprint has a tree canopy. The plan details the environmental benefits of planting shade trees, including species such as oak, ash, elm and sycamore, in place of palms. For example, a 16in trunk diameter live oak tree would remove 510lb of carbon dioxide, 20oz of harmful ozone, and intercept 725 gallons of rainfall per year. By contrast, a native sabal palmetto palm of the same dimensions would absorb only 2.7lb of carbon dioxide, 1.7oz of ozone and 81 gallons of rainfall. “Trees have been proven to be one of the most effective tools for mitigating the effects of climate change,” the plan, drawn up by urban and landscape experts in conjunction with the Florida forestry service, states. “Palms, while an iconic part of Miami Beach’s landscape, have moved from being an accent plant to a major component of the city’s urban forest. General guidelines for species diversity state that no family should make up more than 30% of a city’s tree population.”   \n",

                                                                                                                                                         Can, the German rock band active between 1968 and 1979, have in many ways, through no fault of their own, become the ultimate chin-stroking outfit. Born from Europe’s ruins, boasting two former students of avant-garde composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, a free-jazz drummer who restricted himself to relentless grooves and two ethnically diverse singers, their collision of postwar high culture with 60s counterculture makes them prime egghead material. Yet they were remarkable. Improvisation was the source of their albums and their incendiary live performances, but they still retained an ear for melody and even a pop sensibility. In concert they could be intense and, ironically for a group now so beloved of fashionable music commentators, a good few early fans were downright “heavies”: bikers and stoners drawn to the Can lack of compromise. In their first six albums, the band managed to anticipate jazz-rock, punk and sampling, as well as drum’n’bass techno. Can’s reputation in the UK took off when they began to be namechecked by new wave musicians: Pete Shelley, John Lydon, Gary Numan, Ultravox, then later the Fall, the Jesus & Mary Chain and Primal Scream. To my generation, this cast Can as a mythical band, whose improvised three-hour concerts have a trapped-in-amber feel, confined as they are to the lost 70s. Owning their own recording studio, they amassed hundreds, maybe thousands of hours of unreleased music. The astonishing early albums – the raw Monster Movie, the epic Tago Mago, or the blissful Future Days – were strong enough to support any myths we wanted to believe. Later, recordings did emerge from the vaults, but nothing quite equalled the originals, and due to record company neglect, no perfect, definitive recording of their in-concert prowess remains – just tantalising segments. In 1997 Can gave over their entire back catalogue for the album Sacrilege, allowing classic tracks to be radically remixed by drum’n’bass musicians. It is very hard to imagine many other bands of the 70s allowing their work to be similarly reformed – nor the motivation to embark on such a project. But the music of Can seems to offer something uniquely creative to each new generation of musicians and listeners. It is telling, 20 years on, how dated Sacrilege now sounds compared with the original albums. Rob Young’s All Gates Open might or might not be the definitive biography of this slippery and protean band. It is an admirable work of loving and careful research. Young handles facts efficiently and turns up gems such as a cracking 1971 letter from Stockhausen to the immigration department of Cologne, protesting the possible expulsion of Can’s Japanese vocalist, Damo Suzuki. For someone just discovering the band’s music, All Gates Open has a superb narrative arc, especially when dealing with their formation, background and the creation of those great early albums. For Can trainspotters like me, there is not enough new material: where are the specific tour details and dates, an analysis of the mythical Can recording archives, fleshed out lives of the Can members while the band was active? Sometimes the eccentric, unique personalities of the band members get lost in the march of events and album chronology. A single page can reference Goethe, Roman emperor Carus, Alexander von Humbold, Schopenhauer, Beethoven and Schubert. This is justified as a serious and successful attempt to position Can in the cultural context they deserve to be situated in. But again we often feel we are getting away from the quotidian facts, from the grit of what it was actually like on tour with Can in 1972. The book is enhanced by the inclusion of an appendix of writings curated by Can’s keyboard player Irmin Schmidt and includes some of his personal journals. In many ways this anthology of reflections and dialogues on art, on Can and on life, is a more revealing endeavour than traditional rock biography, with all its demands and limitations. The only surviving German member of the band, Schmidt is a European intellectual with a love for all the arts; but he is also a mischievous iconoclast. His exchanges with figures as diverse as Wim Wenders, Mark E Smith and John Malkovich make for fascinating and thoughtful reading. The Can story continues because their music lives – and those albums will still sound as great to our children. • Alan Warner’s Can’s Tago Mago is published by Bloomsbury.

The Golden State Warriors were aiming for the best win-loss record in NBA history. Meanwhile, the San Antonio Spurs had a 13-game winning streak and were on pace to put up the best point differential the league has ever seen. Monday’s game was hyped as a must-watch event: the Warriors’ unstoppable offense against the Spurs’ impossible defense. Well, the Warriors promptly solved that impossible defense, and basketball fans were treated to yet another Warriors blowout. Golden State demolished San Antonio 120-90. There was very little the Spurs could do. Putting Kawhi Leonard, the reigning defensive player of the year, on Steph Curry only briefly slowed him down. Curry scored 37 points in the game, despite sitting for the entire fourth quarter.\\nEven for those who have enjoyed watching the Warriors embarrass opposing teams, Monday’s game was a disappointment. There was no drama, no suspense, no intrigue. Fans were promised a historic clash. Instead, they witnessed the basketball version of the NFC championship game between the Panthers and the Cardinals. (Curry was playing playing the role of Cam Newton, obviously.) Now, this was only one game, and it may end up being just an aberration. The Spurs were playing at Oracle Arena, where the Warriors have yet to lose all season, and without Tim Duncan, who sat out with knee soreness. Although his days as a MVP candidate are firmly in the past, Duncan’s presence would have made a difference, albeit probably not a 30- point one. The two teams next play on 19 March, in San Antonio, with the Spurs potentially at full strength. If the Spurs pull off victory there, or even suffer a close loss, we’ll all go back daydreaming about a seven-game Western Conference finals between the two. But maybe that is wishful thinking. It’s also possible that these Warriors have no rival and will continue to decimate the NBA like an invasive species without a natural predator. This was the second time in two weeks that the Warriors embarrassed one of the teams that supposedly had a shot at knocking them out of the playoffs. Last week, they took on the Cavaliers in what was supposed to be an NBA finals preview. That turned out to be a 34-point road win for the Warriors. That loss spurred a coaching change and questions about whether Cleveland’s LeBron James-Kyrie Irving-Kevin Love super-team was doomed by the Warriors’ mere existence. It’s to the point where the NBA might have a Superman problem on its hands. As many attempted movie adaptations will attest, it’s notoriously difficult to develop engaging stories about Superman, a character so powerful he can do just about anything. It’s difficult to come up with believable scenarios for Superman where there’s any drama or provide him with opponents that represent any realistic danger. Greatness, no matter how impressive, can end up being boring without legitimate conflict. We’re not at that point with the Warriors yet, but Monday night’s win suggests that this rest of this season could end up completely lacking suspense – unless a team figures out what their Kryptonite could be. Video of the week\\nThe Phoenix Suns and the Atlanta Hawks couldn’t duplicate this series of ridiculous offensive mistakes if they spent weeks practicing choreography. It’s almost annoying when Kent Bazemore finally makes a shot. How did LeBron carry the Cavaliers this week? I’m not sure if “carried” is right term for this, but the events of the last week certainly have revealed exactly how much weight LeBron James holds within the organization. It’s widely believed that James was instrumental in his team’s decision to replace head coach David Blatt with assistant Tyronn Lue on Friday. Publicly, James had said he was surprised by Blatt’s firing, and maybe he didn’t directly request the change, but nobody believes the team would have make such a drastic move if James were against it. Judging by the reports that followed the announcement, the only real surprise that James could have is in the fact that Blatt lasted as long as he did. Quote of the week If David Blatt’s getting fired, how in the hell do the rest of us have jobs? Because our front offices aren’t quite as crazy as theirs. – Detroit Pistons head coach Stan Van Gundy on Blatt’s firing. The Notorious SVG has a point. Under Blatt, the Cavaliers had a 30-11 record and was comfortably at the top of the Eastern Conference standings. Most franchises wouldn’t make a change under these circumstances, but most franchises aren’t run by Dan Gilbert. Of course, Van Gundy, of all people, should realize that basketball teams have no shame when it comes to firing head coaches to placate a superstar player.\\nPower rankings 1. Golden State Warriors (Last week: 1) It’s not entirely the case that the Warriors don’t have a true rival, it’s just that the team they’re playing against hasn’t existed for nearly 20 years. With their Monday night win, the Warriors improved their record to 41-4, tying the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls for the best start in NBA history. At this point of the season, 72-10 seems like a very possible goal. 2. San Antonio Spurs (2) Before Monday’s loss to the Warriors, there was an argument that the Spurs were actually the best team in the NBA despite their less impressive record. Now? Now it would be easier to defend BoB’s claim that the earth is flat. 3. Oklahoma City Thunder (4) The Thunder had a seven-game win streak going until they lost a blizzard-delayed game against the Nets on Sunday. Maybe the Nets should only play on snow days from here on out. 4. Cleveland Cavaliers (3) Another ripple effect from the Blatt firing? LeBron James is now almost as hated in Israel, where Blatt coached Maccabi Tel Aviv, as he was in Ohio after The Decision. 5. Los Angeles Clippers (5) First, the Clippers steal the Pistons’ move of letting Josh Smith go for nothing. Then comes the news that Blake Griffin will miss significant amount of time after injuring his hand in an “undisclosed team-related incident.” Later rumors emerge that this incident was a fistfight with a member of the equipment staff that began in a restaurant. Other than all that, things have been quiet on the Clipper front. 6. Toronto Raptors (6) Congratulations Toronto, you’re currently in the weird, nebulous position that is “second best in the Eastern Conference.” Don’t get comfortable: some other team will take your place within the week, if not days. Also, congratulations to Kyle Lowry for rightfully getting voted in as an All-Star Game starter. That’s a much less tenuous achievement. 7. Chicago Bulls (7) Normally, when a team goes through a coaching change, a team is motivated to make sure their next game is a big win. The Bulls would have none of it, solidly beating the Cavaliers on their home floor in the first game of the post-Blatt era, causing their own fans to turn against them. 8. Atlanta Hawks (10) Remember last year, when nearly the entire Hawks’ starting lineup went to the All-Star Game? This year, there’s a good chance Paul Millsap will be their lone representative when the reserves are announced on Thursday. 9. Dallas Mavericks (9) Speaking of the All-Star Game, did you know that Zaza Pachulia was almost voted in as a starter? It’s true, thanks to the efforts of the entire country of Georgia, a Fugee and a Vine celebrity. Also: did you know that Vine celebrities can influence popular voting now and that this is absolutely terrifying on a wide variety of levels? 10. Memphis Grizzlies (8) Grizzlies GM Chris Wallace says he won’t be “compelled” to make a move before the trade deadline. Translation: he knows they have no shot of beating the Warriors, Spurs or the Thunder in the playoffs. 11. Houston Rockets (14) The Rockets, breaking new ground in their mission to make basketball as painful to watch as possible, intentionally fouled Andre Drummond 21 times during a loss to the Detroit Pistons. 12. Miami Heat (11) “Hey, Mr Riley, this is Ray Allen’s lawyer. If you continue to call my client, we will have no other option but to take out that restraining order we’ve talked about.” 13. Detroit Pistons (13) The Spurs’ loss on Monday means that, improbably, the Pistons remain the last team to beat the Warriors. 14. Boston Celtics (16) Anonymous, confidential message to Danny Ainge: “Give Avery Bradley anything and everything he wants, my heart cannot take him leaving. Sincerely, HF.” 15. Indiana Pacers (12) The Pacers lost to the Warriors by a mere 12 points last Friday, which clearly means they’re objectively a better team than both the Spurs and the Cavaliers. 16. Charlotte Hornets (21) Kemba Walker won Eastern Conference player of the week honors and has a small but non-zero chance of making the All-Star Game. All of this is confusing. 17. Sacramento Kings (22) While the Warriors and Spurs were playing what was supposed to be the game of the century, the Kings’ DeMarcus Cousins was busy scoring 56 points against the Hornets. The Hornets still won. 18. New York Knicks (15) In a 97-84 loss to the Hornets, Jeremy Lin scored 26 points against his old team, which served as a reminder of the golden age of Linsanity, back when the Guardian had an entire tag devoted to him. 19. Washington Wizards (18) The Wizards are currently under .500 and out of the playoff picture. Maybe it’s time for a coaching change. Is there anybody that just became available? 20. Orlando Magic (17) The Magic lost their sixth straight game on Monday, an overtime loss to the Memphis Grizzlies. 2016 has been particularly unkind to them. 21. Portland Trail Blazers (20) 22. Utah Jazz (19) 23. Milwaukee Bucks (23) 24. Denver Nuggets (24) 25. New Orleans Pelicans (26) 26. Minnesota Timberwolves (25) 27. Phoenix Suns (26) 28. Brooklyn Nets (27) 29. Los Angeles Lakers (28) 30. Philadelphia 76ers (30)   \n",

                                  An Israeli border police officer who fatally shot a Palestinian teenager at a demonstration while the boy was posing no threat to soldiers has been sentenced to nine months in prison after a protracted court process. The father of 17-year-old Nadeem Nawara, whose case was covered by the Guardian and other international media four years ago, described the sentence for causing death by negligence as “ridiculous” and claimed that the officer, Ben Deri, had murdered his son. Deri’s plea bargain was held up by the teenager’s family and others in comparison to the long prison sentences typically handed down by the courts to Palestinians found guilty of killing Israelis. Nadeem was one of three Palestinian teenagers shot with live ammunition over a period of over an hour during a stone-throwing demonstration near Ofer prison on 15 May 2014, the day each year when Palestinians mark the Nakba, or “catastrophe”, the war around the time of the creation of Israel in 1948. Mohammad Salameh, 16, was fatally shot an hour after Nawara, and Mohamed al-Azi, who was 15 at the time, survived a gunshot wound to the chest. At the time an Israeli military spokesman tried to deflect outrage over the shootings, claiming footage had been edited to present an unfair picture of events.\\nThe sentence on Wednesday comes as Israeli security forces’ use of live fire is again in the spotlight after the fatal shooting of several dozen Palestinians at the Gaza border fence in recent weeks Deri was tried only for firing the fatal shots that killed Nadeem, as only the teenager’s family allowed for the body to be exhumed and an autopsy to be carried out. The examination found Nadeem had been killed by an Israeli M16 roundto the chest. The prosecution demonstrated in court that police and soldiers at the scene had been ordered only to use rubber-coated steel pellets, and that Deri had replaced the magazine on his M16 with one containing live rounds. At 1.45pm, four minutes after Nadeem threw a stone at Israeli forces, Deri shot him in the chest. Video footage seen by the Guardian at the time and taken from a nearby security camera showed that Nadeem was 80-200 metres from the soldiers when he was shot. The court agreed to a plea bargain which dropped a charge of manslaughter, describing Deri’s actions as having involving a “high degree of negligence” when he loaded his weapon with live bullets. Deri was ordered to pay the victim’s family $14,000 (£10,000). “This is not how justice is done,” said Nadeem’s father, Siam Nawara, after the sentencing. “I never expected the Israeli court to do justice for my martyred son, but I had to do all I can to present a solid case and to expose the Israeli judicial system before the world and I did.” He added: “Ben Deri who murders – and I am convinced that he intentionally committed murder – gets nine months and in the height of chutzpah I hear that they are considering appealing the severity of the sentence. “We are dealing with an entire system that discriminates on the basis of race and arrives at decisions that are far from just.” The case leaves multiple questions unanswered, including whether it was Deri or or others who fired the other live rounds. The court accepted that Deri had made two weapons handling errors that led him to fire the round that killed Nadeem. The method used by Israeli border police to fire large rubber bullets from an M16 rifle requires the use of a long barrel extension preventing live rounds being fired through it. The rubber bullet is placed in the extension and blank cartridges are loaded into the gun itself, with the force of the explosion from the blanks propelling the projectile. “The defendant did not check that his magazine contained only blanks and did not load a rubber bullet into the [barrel extension] as required. These two oversights, which amount to gross negligence, caused the death of the deceased,” the court judgment said.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Canada’s most populous province has signed a long-awaited deal with the federal government for subsidized childcare, paving the way for a nationwide plan that Justin Trudeau hailed as a “historic moment”. Unveiling the plan on Monday, the prime minister pledged that fees will eventually drop to C$10 a day by 2026, but experts caution that the plan must reckon with the reality of chronic staff shortages, fierce demand for limited spaces and murky funding agreements. Trudeau and Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, announced billions in funding for the province, part of a broader multibillion-dollar package offered to all provinces and territories. “Childcare is becoming a reality for all Canadians,” said Trudeau. Ford, who had held out for nearly a year for more money from Ottawa, is the last leader to sign on to the national childcare plan.\\nBut Monday’s announcement is essentially the amount of money offered to Ontario last year. “It’s unfortunate that it took this long, because the longer it takes to make the agreements, the longer it’s going to take to implement,” said Sarah Kaplan, director of the Institute for Gender and the Economy at the University of Toronto. “Families in Ontario have been missing out on the progress that could have been made.” Ontario has the highest childcare costs in the country; in Toronto families often pay more than C$1,600 a month for childcare. The new deal would, on average, cut fees in half by the end of 2022. Other provinces that signed agreements earlier have seen fees drop sharply. But Kaplan and others worry the early figures from deals announced by other provinces suggest they are not yet on track to reach their goal by 2026. “Unless something changes, you’ll still see low-income families paying upwards of 40% of their income, for childcare. That is not ‘affordable’,” she said. Additionally, Canada is struggling to train, hire and retain early childhood educators, many of whom are leaving the field amid frustrations over low pay. Without enough staff in childcare centres, families will be left waiting for space, or pushed to higher-cost options. For decades, a nationwide affordable childcare system has proven elusive for the governing Liberals. A previous attempt to introduce such a scheme was scuttled by an election defeat in 2006, but Canada’s decentralized governance system, in which provinces hold immense power, has also been blamed for hampering the rollout of a national plan. “At the end of the day, the federal government’s hands are tied and families are beholden to what provinces choose to do and if they are really going to take childcare seriously,” said Kaplan. Quebec implemented low-cost childcare in 1997 and economists say the province demonstrated the costs were easily recovered by a sharp increase in workforce participation, especially among women. When she announced the aim of nationwide affordable childcare last year, deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland pointed to the effects the coronavirus pandemic was having on women in the workforce. “Covid has brutally exposed something women have long known: without childcare, parents – usually mothers – can’t work,” she said, calling it an “investment worth making”.\\nAffordable childcare has become an important progressive issue during the pandemic, and in the United States, Joe Biden has tried – and failed – to include similar efforts in his administration’s proposed Build Back Better legislation. In both Canada and the US, there is a growing effort to recast childcare as both an investment in infrastructure, similar to roads and bridges, and as a ‘job creator’. “We told Minister Freeland, and all the other ministers involved, that were was a limited window of opportunity too, because the pandemic has opened people’s eyes to these issues. Luckily, they took it,” said Kaplan. “And Canada should be commended for making progress now. But honestly, this should have happened 20 years ago.”   \n",

golf course on his Aberdeenshire estate, more than a decade after it was first promised. Local councillors are expected to rubberstamp the proposal on Tuesday after it was endorsed by Aberdeenshire’s planning officers, days before the council votes on a far more controversial bid by the Trump Organization to build 550 luxury homes nearby. The new 18-hole course, to be named MacLeod course after Trump’s mother Mary, will sit alongside the first loss-making championship course that opened at Menie north of Aberdeen in 2012. Trump has also owned the Turnberry golf resort in Ayrshire since 2014. Local community councillors believe the MacLeod course will benefit the area by boosting tourism, and help it recover from a slump caused by the collapse in oil prices, which hit Aberdeen’s North Sea oil and gas industries. But critics are doubtful about the course’s viability and believe it can only be funded by the construction and sale of the 550 luxury and holiday homes, which councillors will be voting on at a separate meeting on Thursday. The properties are expected to cost about £20m to build, with the largest one expected to sell for more than £1m each. The existing course and boutique hotel at MacLeod House have consistently lost money since they opened. Local people say the championship course, which closes for five months during the winter and is hit regularly by bad weather during the summer, is routinely empty.\\nThe latest accounts for the Trump International Golf Club Scotland show the business lost more than £1m in 2017 on a turnover of £2.5m, with the downturn cutting its income by 3% that year. Its survival is dependent on historic loans from President Trump totalling £40m and a top-up loan in 2017 of £1.3m from the DJT Holdings LLC, the parent company which also owns various other Trump Organization companies. But DJT Holdings LLC is under investigation by US prosecutors probing allegations Trump’s firms have profited from his presidency, although the inquiry is not thought to include his Aberdeenshire resort. The two golf courses were given outline planning permission in 2008 as part of Trump’s plans for a £750m golfing resort featuring an eight-storey five-star hotel, timeshare flats, conference centre, spa golfing academy, shops and sports facilities. None of those are expected to be built. That scheme floundered after the banking crisis, leaving critics of the scheme furious. The project involved the removal or remodelling of a large area of rare mobile dunes, which were legally protected as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). In June, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)announced it would strip the dunes of their SSSI designation. Among 15 conditions attached to the second golf course scheme, Aberdeenshire has told the Trump Organization it must have environment and habitat management plans for the site to protect its dunes, badgers and otters, and an outdoor access plan to protect public rights of way. David Wallace, the chairman of Belhelvie community council, which includes the nearby village of Balmedie,expressed concerns about construction traffic clogging up local roads while the new course and housing were under construction. The resort had originally been due to have a new road and junction, which was not being built. The council have significant reservations about the housing scheme but supported the new course. “We quite enjoy the fact we have such a prestigious golf course on our doorstep. It does bring people to the area but it is an expensive place to play,” Wallace said. The application for the second course was first submitted to Aberdeenshire council in September 2015 and appeared to lapse for several years. No new documents were submitted between August 2017 until earlier this year, seven months after the Trump Organization put forward its plans for the 550 houses in July 2018. David Milne, a fierce critic of Trump who lives near the resort’s clubhouse, said it was clear the housing scheme was needed to fund the resort. “The money has to come from somewhere,” he said. “There are not enough people playing that golf course to make it viable, and there never will be.”   \n",

have been given extra time to continue discussions aimed at restoring a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland secretary, James Brokenshire, announced on Monday night there was “further progress” made at the talks in Stormont. Brokenshire held back from his threat to impose a budget, which would signal a partial return to direct rule from London. Responding to the progress at the talks, the secretary of state said: “[The parties] are making certain additional requests of the UK government which we need to consider. In the light of this, I believe it is right to defer the assessment on whether to introduce legislation to parliament this week to enable an executive to be formed. The parties will recommence talks in the morning and I will reassess the position tomorrow night.” The extension in the deadline came hours after Theresa May said she preferred the restoration of devolution in Northern Ireland rather than direct rule from London.\\nA spokesman for May said the British and Irish governments would work with both parties to secure a deal that would bring back power-sharing government in Belfast. He said: “We are clear we don’t want to see a return to direct rule, we want a return of devolved government in Northern Ireland, so that local decisions can be made by local politicians. “James Brokenshire has been clear that the latest we can practically introduce legislation to enable the executive’s formation would be this week in order for it to be in time for a new executive to set a budget.” The spokesman said the Northern Ireland secretary would update parliament later in the week about the state of play. Ireland’s foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, arrived in Belfast on Monday in a bid to help the parties reach a deal, saying on Twitter that it was an important day for Northern Ireland.\\nEarlier on Monday, the DUP, which props up May’s government, urged the Brokenshire to impose a budget on the region. The DUP’s suggestion indicated that the party saw little chance of an 11th hour deal with Sinn Féin that would restore the power-sharing government. Brokenshire had warned that he would be forced to draw up a budget by the end of Monday in order fund regional government departments in Northern Ireland. Otherwise, the local ministries could run out of money. The DUP said: “Our position has not changed. We want to see an executive set up; we would have done it March and sorted these issues in tandem. Progress would only be made towards a deal when Sinn Féin drops its ’red-line demands’. Given Sinn Féin have dragged their feet over the last 10 months, the secretary of state should bring forward a budget to bring a measure of good government to Northern Ireland.” The party added that it was still in favour of devolution for Northern Ireland if a deal could be reached. Sinn Féin said a deal could only be secured on the grounds of equality for all. The party’s key demand in the talks, which the DUP has resisted, is for the introduction of an Irish language act. This would give the Gaelic language having an equal status in law to English throughout Northern Ireland. Former Stormont minister Conor Murphy said any deal had to be for all and not just the political leadership of unionism. He said: ”That requires an end to the DUP’s denial of rights citizens enjoy everywhere else on these islands: language rights, marriage rights and the right to a coroner’s court.” The smaller nationalist party, the Social Democratic and Labour party, has called for joint authority over Northern Ireland by London and Dublin in the absence of a power-sharing administration. This is unlikely given the influence the DUP exercises at Westminster in holding the balance of power in the House of Commons.   \n",

pianist on earth at the moment but the Berlin-based “neo-classical” star Nils Frahm will be the first to admit that he’s not a classical pianist of any description. In this two-hour show there is little harmony or chordal development, scarcely any improvisation, and – with the exception of the jagged, nerve-wracking, Michael Nyman-ish piano solo Hammers – little virtuosity. What you get in spades, however, is texture – something that the classical conservatoires and jazz modules have always ignored. You can buy the sheet music for Frahm’s piano solos, but the notes that he rattles out on his panoply of keyboards are almost incidental. What’s important is the tone; the grain; the satisfying way in which each studio-crafted voicing plonks and zings and bounces around the auditorium. Frahm even jokes about these limitations. “People seem to like that track where I play one chord for seven minutes,” he deadpans. “If I presented that at some really good music school they’d tell me it’s not even a track. It’s not even an idea.” Indeed, placing Frahm in the “classical” racks is a category error. His methodology has always been that of a dance music producer: using hypnotic repetition, delayed climaxes, and the kind of mutating voicings you find in filtered disco. The irony is that, when he moves into actual rave music, playing from his latest album All Melody, it doesn’t really work, at least not in this sit-down venue. It’s technically impressive to see him loop beats and basslines in real time, leaping between two U-shaped banks of keyboards – including a harmonium, a toy piano, a Fender Rhodes, a Steinway grand, a homemade organ, a Roland synth and a heavily dampered upright piano – but the results are rather generic, like a preset voicing on a home organ. What works, however, are the piano solos. These are internalised raves; quiet riots; exercises in acoustic acid house that transport you to a higher plane while remaining oddly static.\\n   \n",

                                                                                         As our cities’ skylines spiral upwards, we have grown accustomed to increasingly bad street art. For self-preservation, we train our eyes to dull the slogans that cover the buildings that gentrification means many can no longer afford to enter, but the white words painted on a wall in Shoreditch, east London, will stay with me: “Sex with refugees is jasmine-scented and beautiful”. The words, which have now been painted over, stunned me. Artist Robert Montgomery says that the words were ripped from another piece of his. This reads: “The refugees are beautiful, they bring ancient music and desert sweets and jasmine-filled sex”, which he happily posted for us all to see. On Facebook he denied creating the Shoreditch graffiti. But either version of the sentiment shows ignorance over the words and social misconceptions about the current refugee crisis.\\nIt is with a deep bitterness that it has to be spelled out that neither love nor sex is the solution. My mother was born in Malaysia, and this language echoes the colonial narrative that makes me feel sick. Throughout history, women of colour have been presented as alluring and tantalisingly exotic. The repercussions of this are felt through porn, advertising and experiences that women of colour have while dating. This piece of art mirrors that. The choice of language presents sex with another human as essentially different, foreign or fetish. This is not a great basis for relationships nor a way to bring about racial equality. As Jinan Petra, a campaigner against immigration detention, tells me: “To write such racist, orientalist, harmful bullshit about people who have been through so much – including sexual violence – in migration ... there are very few words. I’m a Syrian woman and in my professional and personal life I know that these views exist; the sentiment and the entitlement don’t surprise me.”\\nFrom my own work with female refugees, I am painfully aware of the sexual violence that vulnerable people face. While preparing to teach film-making to young asylum seekers and undocumented youth, we were faced with the grim reality that assault and rape were common. Not only is the journey notoriously perilous, the dangers don’t stop when you arrive in Britain. Without secure status, you are at the whim of those around you. For some, this has meant staying in abusive “romantic” relationships, while others have faced sexual violence from guards inside detention facilities. Even if you do happen to be in a loving relationship, Theresa May’s “hostile environment” can make it difficult. One evening, as the sun set, I awkwardly looked away as a man told his wife he loved her inside Yarl’s Wood immigration detention centre. “Don’t touch her,” a guard barked. They dropped their hands, wondering if this is what intimacy meant now. All the love in the world means nothing without money for a visa. While the Shoreditch “artwork” is disappointing, its obliviousness comes as no surprise. In British schools, we are not taught the true legacies of colonialism nor how people’s livelihoods have been damaged by our warfare. This accounts for people’s shock over the treatment of migrants in Libya. Often, the charity campaigns surrounding the refugee crisis are no better. Take the Save the Children advert that attempted to garner sympathy through the narrative of a white young girl, asking what if this happened in Europe. It ignored and erased the historical reasons as to why this is not happening here.\\nSimilarly, statements such as “refugees are welcome” is a powerful rallying cry but ignores that the UK has one of the biggest and most cruel detention facilities in Europe. Refugees can be held indefinitely. This is how our government “secures” our borders; it isn’t something we can shag away. From the perspective of Aleksandra Bilic, a film-maker who came to this country as a child refugee herself: “It is hard to realise that problems cannot be solved without confronting the greater factors at play and that these issues are beyond ourselves. But this is not a topic for artists to literally fuck with, as these are real issues. If you are going to speak on them, you should try and understand them.” This isn’t to say artists shouldn’t tackle political causes in their work. We need political art with teeth. But our talk of politics comes at a high cost. We have a responsibility to do our research, know the context that our work operates in and be genuinely informed about the cause we seek to amplify. If you do, it’ll prevent wasting time painting over shallow and harmful statements that nobody asked to see. • Jade Jackman is a documentary film-maker and writer based in London   \n",

                                                                                                                     Tens of thousands of people, many of them children skipping school, braved heavy rain to join a climate strike headed by Greta Thunberg in Bristol city centre. The vast crowd fell silent as the 17-year-old activist told them governments were acting like children and so it fell to young people to be “the adults in the room”. Police said there were more than 15,000 people at the Bristol Youth Strike 4 Climate event, while Thunberg estimated the figure as at least 30,000. As Thunberg spoke, onlookers clambered on to bus shelters and up trees and hung out of windows to catch a glimpse. Criticising governments and the media, she said: “Once again they sweep their mess under the rug for us – young people, their children – to clean up for them. We must continue and we have to be patient. Remember that the changes required will not happen overnight.” Thunberg arrived in Bristol by train and was driven to the climate strike in a red Nissan Leaf electric car. Wearing a yellow raincoat and woolly hat – a look copied by some of her devotees – she took to the stage to chants of “Greta, Greta” from schoolchildren and teenagers.\\nShe told them: “We will not be silenced because we are the change, and change is coming whether you like it or not. This emergency is being completely ignored by the politicians, the media and those in power. “Basically, nothing is being done to halt this crisis despite all the beautiful words and promises from our elected officials. So what did you do during this crucial time? I will not be silenced when the world is on fire.” Thunberg flagged up the recent decision by north Somerset council to oppose Bristol airport expansion as an example of what could be achieved if activists worked together. The Swedish teenager went on to join protesters on a march through the city centre accompanied by a samba band. She waved at well-wishers and at one point consoled a child who was clearly overwhelmed by the experience. Avon and Somerset police had warned of the potential for protesters to be hurt and urged parents not to allow children to go unaccompanied. Bristol Cathedral, which sits on College Green, was ready to open its doors to anyone needing refuge but the organisers insisted they had put enough measures in place to make sure nobody was hurt.\\nThe poor weather did not dampen enthusiasm. Alison Thomson, who brought along her 10-year-old daughter, Emily, said: “I thought she might be a bit young but she said this would be her only chance to see [Thunberg] speak so I agreed.” Emily said: “I think it’s really important that people understand what is happening to the Earth.” She was returning to school after the event to give a presentation on climate change.\\nIsaac and Maya Swann, 11 and 15, had persuaded their mother, Karen Davies, to bring them along. Maya said: “We want to help make a change. Greta’s really brave and inspirational, giving up part of her childhood to spread this message. It was cold and wet but it is was worth it. It was exciting to see how many people care.” Davies said: “I was against them taking time off school but last night they came to me and said they felt if I was their age I would be there. They were right. I’d be in the thick of it. I sent an email to the school and they were supportive. I think many schools see it as educational. It was a lovely experience … It’s good to see that so many people can be inspired by one girl.”\\nHannah Burge, 12, and Harvey Hennessy, 16, have organised school strikes in Barnstaple, north Devon. Their biggest turnout has been 850. “It’s been amazing seeing so many people here,” said Hannah. “Greta is such a role model for us.” Mya-Rose Craig, 17, an ornithologist who recently became the youngest person in the UK to be awarded an honorary doctorate, said: “It’s so cool to see so many thousands of young people here ready to fight for our future.” Ed Thompson, a housemaster at Clifton college, took overseas boarders aged 11-13 and the school’s “green team” to the event. He said: “We have discussed Greta’s influence in school, and she is a true icon to all ages for her passion, determination, tenacity and likability. The word ‘inspiration’ is too often used, but she is a guiding light to the next generation for peaceful but powerful activism, and encouraging love and care for our environment, which is such a strong message for young people.”\\nThe crowd was swollen by many students who were missing lectures, tutorials and lab sessions. But it was not just young people who attended. There were groups of doctors, nurses and even a collective of wildlife film-makers. One moment of tension came when police equipped with video cameras moved through the crowd pointing their lenses at strikers, including a group from the Public and Commercial Services Union. Some employers had turned a blind eye to workers taking time to attend. Good Energy, a green energy company from Chippenham in Wiltshire, went further by actively telling its 250-strong workforce to join the strike. The mayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees, tweeted:\\n   \n",

                                                        Authorities issued an emergency warning for an uncontrolled bushfire which threatening lives and homes in Bullsbrook, northeast of Perth on Thursday afternoon. Meanwhile, a “watch and act” alert was issued for a bush blaze near St Marys on Tasmania’s east coast where residents were being urged to enact bushfire plans. It came as heatwave conditions began to hit large swathes of Australia’s eastern and southern coasts, bringing high fire danger to the bushfire-ravaged states of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. While both fires in Perth and Tasmania were downgraded on Thursday evening, the Bullsbrook fire northeast of Perth remains out of control despite conditions easing slightly. The blaze is now at “watch and act” level, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services says. The bushfire about 1.5km west of the St Marys township in Tasmania was brought under control on Thursday evening but severe fire danger will persist on the east coast, southeast and central regions on Friday. As dozens of fires continued to burn across the country, the Bureau of Meteorology forecast a top of 39C in Melbourne on Thursday, while people in Adelaide (42C) and Canberra (37C) were also set to swelter. The NSW government also announced an inquiry into the unprecedented bushfire crisis, which the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, pledged would “leave no stone unturned”. Three firefighters were injured, while another has escaped unharmed, after a tree fell on to their truck in the Australian Capital Territory. The crew were working to slow the spread of the 15,000-hectare Orroral Valley fire on Wednesday night when the tree crashed on to the tanker.\\nThree of them suffered non-life threatening injuries. All four crew members were taken by ambulance to the Canberra hospital for assessment. Authorities in Victoria are continuing to open roads in fire-affected communities that had been isolated in the aftermath of devastating fires at the start of the month. After confirming about 250 people had been able to return to Mallacoota, the Victorian emergency management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, warned of the weather ahead. “Thursday will be warm, but Friday is a significant day for us with elevated fire conditions,” he said. “There’ll be storms that come through with the potential for dry lightning, so again it’s a challenging day for us.”\\nIn Canberra, where a massive bushfire south-west of the city came dangerously close to homes, authorities used improved conditions on Wednesday to prepare for what was forecast to be four days of sustained dry heat. The temperature was expected to hit 42C by Saturday, before a storm front comes through the city on Sunday. The ACT’s emergency services commissioner, Georgeina Whelan, said authorities hoped backburning operations would slow the spread of the 10,000ha Orroral Valley fire. Smoke from the blaze, which was described as most serious the capital has faced since the deadly 2003 bushfires, was expected to linger over the capital on Thursday morning. The fire is believed to have been started by a defence helicopter’s landing light after it landed in Namadgi national park while on a reconnaissance mission. The ACT’s Emergency Services Agency said a southerly wind change would push smoke from the blaze into the city centre. “ There was a “very high” fire danger rating in place for the ACT on Thursday, with temperatures forecast to reach as high as 38C. Meanwhile, the NSW Rural Fire Service said very high and severe fire danger was forecast for parts of state over the coming days, particularly in the south-east. Sydneysiders will be spared the worst of the heatwave, with a top of 29C on Thursday, steadily rising to 34C on Saturday. But across the fire-ravaged south coast, the bureau of forecast a top of 43C in Bega and 39C in Bermagui. In South Australia, authorities have declared severe bushfire conditions in six districts, with a total fire ban in place on Thursday for lower Eyre Peninsula, the mid-north, the Mount Lofty Ranges, Yorke Peninsula, the lower south-east and on Kangaroo Island. On Kangaroo Island, which has been devastated by fire, earthmoving equipment, water tankers and extra fire crews have been sent to strategic locations amid fears that hot spots across the existing fire ground could flare.\\nThe blaze – which has burnt through more than 210,000ha – is officially contained but the Country Fire Service has said crews were still finding hotspots in various areas including Blue Gum Hill, Cygnet River and Vivonne Bay. While the mercury was expected 42C on Thursday in Adelaide, it was predicted to soar beyond that in some regional centres, with Cummins, on Eyre Peninsula, among the hottest with a forecast high of 46C. But the heat and high-risk conditions will be relatively short-lived, with storms moving across the state on Friday before heavier rain at the weekend. with Australian Associated Press   \n",

It’s the little things, isn’t it? The disrespect shown towards security and cleaning staff; the wine on the walls; the Downing Street staffer getting so drunk they were sick; two others having a fight; the senior civil servant who texted “we seem to have got away with it”. Sue Gray’s report has not dislodged the prime minister. But it has created an indelible image of the culture he oversaw, and the sense of tacit sanction under which his staff were operating. Jessica Elgot reports that MPs keeping count believe three more letters of no confidence in the prime minister have gone in – but yesterday was also a victory of sorts for Boris Johnson, who emerged wounded but still in place. One Tory MP tells the FT (£) today: “Most of us are resigned to the fact that he won’t be going but that we’ve lost the next general election.” That assessment reflects the larger problem – the fact that Johnson’s purpose as prime minister has narrowed to his own survival, and the way the rest of the political agenda has been co-opted to that end. Alcohol has been consumed, we read; so has Downing Street. Today’s newsletter, with Guardian columnist Rafael Behr, is about how the tail started to wag the big dog, and what that means for how the government operates. That’s right after the headlines. Five big stories Texas shooting | The gunman who killed 21 people in Uvalde signalled his intentions in a Facebook message a few minutes before beginning his attack. Cost of living | Rishi Sunak is expected to set out plans for a controversial windfall tax on energy companies on Thursday, as he proposes measures to ease the pain of rising household bills. Parliament | Sexual abuse, harassment and bullying accusations made against MPs are treated as “mere gossip”, dozens of Conservative staffers have said, in a letter urging Boris Johnson and party HQ to do more to tackle the problem. Medicine | NHS surgeons have successfully performed the world’s first double hand transplant for scleroderma, an autoimmune disease. Steven Gallagher, the recipient, said the operation had given him “a new lease of life”. US | Supermodel Kate Moss testified in the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard defamation trial. Moss said that the rumour that Depp pushed her down a flight of stairs when they were in a relationship was untrue. In depth: ‘Johnson will always act in the interests of whoever he’s most afraid of’\\nAt the end of his statement to the House of Commons yesterday, Boris Johnson tried to draw a line under Sue Gray’s investigation by emphasising his priorities for the future. “I hope very much that now she has reported we will be able to move on and focus on the priorities of the British people,” he said. “That is my mission, that is our mission, that is the mission of the whole of the government, and we will work day and night to deliver it.” It’s a noble sentiment – but one which recent events appear to fatally undermine. Here are some of the ways Johnson’s government appears to have reoriented its mission from the good of the country to the good of the prime minister. *** Big announcements are emerging with suspiciously good timing After weeks of delay and disagreement, a package of measures to help with the cost of living will finally be announced today – and if Rishi Sunak’s embrace of the near-mythological windfall tax helps to turn the page on the Sue Gray fallout, so much the better. The day after Johnson became the first serving prime minister to have been found to have broken the law while in office, the government’s controversial plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda to be processed was all over the front pages. And if Volodymyr Zelenskiy wants to know when he’s going to get a phone call from the British prime minister, all he has to do is set a Google alert for “new Partygate revelations”. Governments always time their announcements for maximum political impact, and dead cats can be so overrated as a theory of politics as to edge into conspiracy. But there is now a sense that governing priorities are being specifically tailored to minimise the harm of the Partygate story to the prime minister, instead of to the benefit of the government and the country as a whole. “I’m generally wary of that sort of thinking,” said Rafael Behr. “But with this lot – one former cabinet office official said to me, if you are ever in doubt about the motives for anything they’re doing, imagine the most cynical, short-termist reason you can think of, and there’s your answer. [Boris’s] entire career has been about getting out of scrapes, and that means there won’t be any sustained thinking behind anything.” *** The people in the background “The entire senior management has changed,” Boris Johnson said yesterday, doughtily ignoring the hecklers who pointed out that actually, one quite important part of the senior management had stayed the same. Nonetheless, it’s true that he has a new chief of staff, a new director of communications, and a new parliamentary private secretary. The question is whether we should be persuaded that this is really about instituting a new working culture – or firming up the prime minister’s grip on power. The most controversial new appointment is one Johnson didn’t mention in the House of Commons: the installation of David Canzini, an acolyte of his previous election guru Sir Lynton Crosby, as deputy chief of staff. Canzini “has a very similar ethos to Dominic Cummings”, said Rafael. His idea, inherited from Crosby, of getting “the barnacles off the boat” and focusing on the most broadly appealing policies, is “a campaign ethos, not a governing ethos”. Canzini has set about instituting “dividing line” policies which are driving the government further to the right. He is said to have been an enthusiastic advocate for the Rwanda policy, and responsible for the government’s decision to drop a ban on conversion therapy for trans people. “It’s kind of amazing that the appointment of deputy chief of staff can change the whole strategic direction of government,” one backbencher told the Times (£) recently. “But that’s a reflection of Boris. For Boris it doesn’t matter what the policies are, as long as he’s still prime minister.” *** Backbenchers are dragging the government to the right When Johnson won an 80-seat majority in the last election, it was hailed by some as a chance for him to show his true colours as a “one nation” Tory or – in his own words – a “Brexity Hezza” who believed Tories should be “the warriors of the dispossessed”. But there is plenty of evidence to suggest that the threat of his removal has been enough to neuter those instincts and force him to pander to the most rightwing voices in his party. “All that’s gone out of the window,” Rafael said. “Johnson knows the underlying dynamics of his party well enough to understand that when you are unpopular, the bit of the party you have to be wary of is the faction that has done in just about every Tory leader in our lifetimes.” Indeed, one MP, described as a senior Brexiteer, told the BBC’s Newsnight last night: “We have to destroy Boris Johnson for the sake of this country and the sake of our party.” That might explain why Johnson delayed – or dumped – measures designed to attack Britain’s obesity crisis, like an end to “buy one get one free” deals on junk food and a pre-9pm watershed for TV advertising. Meanwhile, there are fears the government could soon ditch some of its net-zero commitments, an attack on Channel 4, the abandonment of animal cruelty legislation, and draconian measures against the right to protest. “There was no reason to jettison the obesity stuff other than to appease the mindless libertarian wing,” Rafael said. “I’d keep an eye on the deadline for replacing gas boilers, too.” Not for nothing did right-wingers Peter Bone and Desmond Swayne leap to Johnson’s defence even before the Sue Gray report was published. “They don’t like Boris, and they don’t trust him,” Rafael said. “But they like having a wounded prime minister, who believes in nothing, and bears the imprint of whoever last sat on him, and will always act in the interests of whoever he’s most afraid of.” *** Read more on the Sue Gray report “If being prime minister is to captain a ship, the Johnson of the Gray report commands a cruise vessel,” writes Peter Walker in his analysis. “One where the main task involves being amiable to passengers at the dinner table.” The Guardian’s leader: “Mr Johnson told MPs he took responsibility, but failed to explain how. The assertion was no more convincing than his affectation of humility.” John Crace’s sketch: “‘We are humbled,’ he said with a dismissive, regal wave of his arm. Except he wasn’t at all.” Sue Gray said she did not fully investigate an alcohol-fuelled gathering in the flat shared by the prime minister and his wife Carrie. Aubrey Allegretti reports on Tory MPs’ fears of a “cover-up”. ConservativeHome sees the prime minister’s secret weapon as boredom. “By simply hanging on in there, he has given much of the parliamentary party, and a majority of party members, the time and space in which to become sick and tired of his foes.” What else we’ve been reading It’s been two years since the murder of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.

The front pages\\nThere’s quite a contrast in how the papers report the findings of Sue Gray’s report. “Drinking, fights, vomiting: all in a day’s work, says PM” is the Guardian’s splash headline, while the Mirror says that the government was having parties and “Laughing at us all” while people were sacrificing and mourning alone during lockdown. The Metro picks up the comment from a senior aide to Boris Johnson as its headline – “‘We got away with it’” – and the i runs with the theme of Gray’s conclusion: “‘Failure of leadership’”. In Scotland the Record says “Tory party enough to make you sick”. For some editors, the Gray report is a damp squib. The Mail asks “Is that it?” and the Express has a similar “Really… is this what all the fuss is about”. The Sun declares that “The Party(gate) is over”. The Telegraph leads on “Sunak to extend energy bill relief”, although it does have a front page report headlined “Johnson denies cover-up of ‘Abba party’ at Downing Street flat”. Similarly, the Times leads on “Energy bill handouts to ease the big squeeze” with “Gray report vindicates me over No 10 parties, claims Johnson” as a second story.

Cartoon of the day | Martin Rowson\\nThe Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad\\nAfter the Grenfell Tower caught ablaze in 2017, taking the lives of 72 people, Tayshan Hayden-Smith was, like much of the country, distraught. In an effort to do something he went to local garden centres and plant nurseries to ask for donations to transform the area. Hayden-Smith had become a guerrilla gardener and began dedicating his time to reclaiming community spaces. The space came to be known as the Grenfell Garden of Peace, injecting sense of unity and togetherness into the area. Hayden-Smith is now the founder of Grow2Know and is taking his project to other parts of London. These include the RHS Chelsea flower show, where the Hands Off Mangrove garden this week won a silver gilt medal.

                                                                                                               More than ever before, we must look behind the reported Covid-19 numbers in hospitals and communities to understand what is happening in the pandemic. We also need to better understand how the pandemic is playing out among unvaccinated people, and those who have been vaccinated. To the public, the pandemic was and still is a silent pestilence, made visible by the images of patients fighting for their next breath and reporters at intensive care units talking about the fear of patients and the exhaustion of doctors and nurses from behind their fogged visors. This ongoing horror, which is taking place in ICUs across Britain, is now largely restricted to unvaccinated people. Generally, Covid-19 is no longer a disease of the vaccinated; vaccines tend to limit this suffocating affliction, with a few exceptions. If the protection that vaccines offer against severe Covid-19 began to wane, given that tens of millions of people are now vaccinated in the UK and only a fraction of the population have not received the jab, ICUs would be filled to the brim with vaccinated people. But they are not. Vaccines still seem to give almost complete protection against this form of life-threatening cases of Covid-19. The latest wave of the virus in the UK – with cases rising rapidly in parts of Europe – will directly translate into a stream of mostly unvaccinated patients entering ICU. In the short term, boosters and social restrictions will help prevent Covid-19 from spreading among people who are unvaccinated this winter. But in the long run, the pressure of Covid-19 on ICUs won’t be solved through these measures. The virus will eventually reach unvaccinated people. To prevent serious illness, these people need first and second doses of the vaccine as soon as possible. It is therefore obvious that governments with doses to spare should be making every effort to ensure vaccines urgently reach people who are undecided and unvaccinated. Some countries are already hoping to drive uptake among this group by imposing social restrictions or introducing vaccine mandates. But understanding and dealing with people’s underlying objections to vaccinations would be a visionary project to secure the public’s health, during the pandemic and beyond. In countries with lower vaccination rates, the impact of the current wave on hospital ICUs will be far worse than in Britain. As a proportion of the whole population, vaccination coverage in the UK is 69%, but in Bulgaria it is only 24% and in Slovakia 43%. It is also important to address pockets of unvaccinated people in countries where vaccine uptake is otherwise high. In the US, for example, fewer than 50% of people have received both jabs in certain states. In other states, the rate is 70%.\\nIn this context, it is shameful that in some low-income countries only 5% of the population have received at least one dose, almost a year since the first licensed dose was given in Britain. The director general of the World Health Organization expressed his deep concern last week that there are now six times more booster doses being administered every day than first doses. We are still not doing enough to end the pandemic for the world’s unvaccinated, and governments and manufacturers urgently need to work together to get doses to those in low-income countries, keeping an eye on the long-term gains of global vaccination, despite the challenges posed by the current Covid spike in Europe. For those of us fortunate enough to have already been vaccinated, the story now seems very different. For the most part, we are protected from very severe cases of Covid-19. But it is now clear that even the fully vaccinated can get mild infection with the virus: the effectiveness of two-dose vaccines against mild symptomatic infection now ranges from 44% to 63%, according to the UK Health Security Agency. This lower level of protection is partly a feature of waning immunity against mild infection. It’s also a result of the Delta variant, which is better at infecting people than its predecessors, even when they have vaccine immunity. For most vaccinated individuals, these mild infections are little more than an unpleasant inconvenience. But for those who are very frail, immunocompromised or have underlying health conditions, these infections are enough to destabilise them and lead to hospital admissions, which is what happens every winter with other viruses, including flu. For some, these are serious, life-threatening health problems that add to the pressure on the NHS. But this situation is not the same as the one we faced last year. It’s also worth remembering that while daily hospital admission data includes people with Covid-19, these numbers may also include people admitted for an unrelated illness, an accident or indeed for elective surgery who happened to have tested positive for Covid. It is difficult to know the true burden of disease in hospitals when the background rate of infection in the community continues to be high. Booster doses drive up the antibody levels that are needed to prevent infection. According to recent figures from the UKHSA, they appear to increase protection against Covid-19 to at least 93%. As a consequence, they will help to drive down the number of Covid-19 cases in the community, and reduce the chance that milder infection will occur among vulnerable people that result in hospital admissions. In highly vaccinated regions where the supply of doses is not limited, this is good news. But we don’t yet know how long this boost to protection will last. We need better and cleaner clinical data to understand fully which patients are being admitted to hospital, to improve our assessment of how effective vaccines are at preventing hospital and ICU admission, and to assess who would be most likely to benefit from boosters. It is also important to monitor and assess the duration of the top-up protection afforded by boosters to then inform the best long-term strategy for future control beyond this winter. What this means for people who are vaccinated is that we have our first glimpses of what “living with the virus” might look like, though it will be some time before it is clear where or when this will all level out. There are still questions over whether we will need regular boosters, and who these should target. But the horrors of the pandemic continue unabated for the unvaccinated, who remain at risk wherever in the world they live. We have to do better at delivering first doses to these people by addressing the unequal access to vaccines across the world, and the barriers that exist to vaccine acceptance among some communities.

As the Duke of York, 59, is spotted teeing off at the Real Club Valderrama, the exclusive golf club in Sotogrande, southern Spain, coverage of his controversial former friendship with the disgraced billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein continues to make uncomfortable reading for Buckingham Palace. Once the pilot prince, photographed with a rose clamped between his teeth at a hero’s homecoming following the Falklands war, his public image is now a disaster. The latest optics are grainy video of him at Epstein’s New York mansion, amid reports of royal foot massages dispensed by young women. The duke, first named in US court documents in 2015, has issued outright denials over allegations he had sexual encounters in 2001 with Virginia Roberts, now Giuffre, when she was a 17 -year-old masseuse for Epstein. The claims were struck from the US court record by a judge who described them as “immaterial and impertinent”. Also vehemently denied are allegations, in recently released court papers of the Guiffre case, made by Johanna Sjoberg that Andrew touched her breast while sitting on a couch at Epstein’s home in 2001.\\nWhen the video footage of Andrew waving off a young woman from the convicted sex offender’s residence emerged this month, an equally strong statement, through Buckingham Palace, said the duke was “appalled” by the recent sexual abuse claims levelled at Epstein, 66, who killed himself in jail on 10 August while facing sex trafficking charges. “His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent,” it said. There can be no denial, however, about Andrew’s crass lack of judgment. That video, and a photograph of him walking with Epstein in New York’s Central Park, were taken in 2010 – two years after the billionaire was convicted of soliciting a minor for prostitution and was a registered sex offender. “The situation changed when Epstein was convicted. It was [Andrew’s] conscious decision to stay loyal, to not criticise his friend the convicted paedophile. And, while that may be fine for him, it’s a step too far. What it’s saying is the royal family tolerates this sort of behaviour,” said one veteran royal commentator, who has met Andrew on several occasions, and believes he should now step down from his public roles. Time and again, Andrew, who a courtier once reportedly described as having “a pompous level of self-importance”, has demonstrated an eye-watering lack of judgment. Palace staff have rated him the rudest of royals, according to reports. A secret cable, published on WikiLeaks in 2010, revealed a US ambassador describing Andrew speaking “cockily” during one official lunch, leading to a discussion that “verged on the rude”. He earned the soubriquet Air Miles Andy after the National Audit Office censured his helicopter habit in 2005, which included him spending £32,000 in one year flying to Scotland to the Royal and Ancient club at St Andrews in his capacity as captain. In 2011, following pressure over the Epstein connection, he stood down from his role as UK special representative for trade and investment. It did not help when his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, admitted having accepted £15,000 from Epstein to help pay off her debts. His links have often raised eyebrows; meetings with the Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi’s son Saif; entertaining the son-in-law of Tunisia’s ousted president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali at Buckingham Palace; his relations with Timur Kulibayev, son-in-law of the then president of Kazakhstan, who purchased the duke’s Sunninghill Park home for £3m more than its £12m asking price in 2007. “Rightly, or wrongly, there is a perceived air of arrogance about Andrew, and he is described by various people as boorish and very self-centred,” said Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty Magazine. “Perhaps we shouldn’t be judging the book by its cover. But, certainly, that’s the impression he has given for a very long time.”\\nAndrew’s loyalty to his seemingly perpetually broke former wife, famously photographed having her toes sucked by her “financial adviser” before their 1996 divorce, remains clear. The two live under the same roof, Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park, and are currently holidaying together in Sotogrande. Even after Ferguson was caught trying to sell access to her ex-husband to an undercover reporter for £500,000 – of which the duke denied any knowledge – they remain close. Andrew’s friendship with Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the notorious press baron Robert Maxwell, and a close friend of Epstein’s, first surfaced in 2000 when they appeared together at private parties and celebrity functions in the UK and US. Today he is patron of some 200 charities and organisations, and the Prince Andrew Charitable Trust supports young people, healthcare issues and the participation of the disabled and wounded service personnel in sporting activities. His Pitch@Palace initiative, which links tech entrepreneurs to people who can help their business, is his “passion project” which he has taken global. Long-rumoured to be the Queen’s favourite son, she has made her support clear. The day after Epstein was found dead in a Manhattan jail, Andrew was photographed beaming alongside his mother on the way to church in Crathie, near Balmoral. She made him a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order in 2011, one month after it emerged he had seen Epstein during a private trip to New York. His fate is that of the typical second son, struggling to find a role. “I think despite knowing he was always going to go down the line of succession, the fact that in his youth he was second in line to the throne, and now he is wherever he is, that must be quite a blow to your confidence and feeling of importance,” said Little. • This article was amended on 26 August 2019 to correct the spelling of Timur Kulibayev’s name and clarify that his father-in-law is no longer the president of Kazakhstan.   \n",

housing secretary Ben Carson has claimed, dismaying observers who had modest hopes for his tenure. Carson, the neurosurgeon who heads the agency charged with helping low-income Americans gain access to affordable housing, told Sirius XM radio: “You take somebody who has the right mindset, you can take everything from them and put them on the street, and I guarantee in a little while they’ll be right back up there.” He went on: “And you take somebody with the wrong mindset, you can give them everything in the world, they’ll work their way back down to the bottom.” Poverty and homelessness experts were quick to condemn the remarks.\\n“Every time he says something like this it suggests to me that the mindset of the secretary is just completely out of line with the mission of he department that he’s been selected to run,” Fred Karnas, a senior housing and urban development (HUD) official in the Clinton and Obama administrations, told the Guardian. Karnas said he had had felt “cautious optimism” when Carson was confirmed – former colleagues of his had met Carson to discuss redressing housing discrimination, and expected pushback, but the conversations went well. But he said he was “appalled” by Carson’s latest remarks. The real roots of poverty, Karnas said, “are related to access to employment, access to quality education, obviously racism”. This disappointment in Carson was echoed by Diane Yentel, head of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. After Carson’s confirmation hearing in January, Yentel said the new housing secretary had “clearly taken the time to begin to understand and come to appreciate the importance of HUD’s programs”. In response to his comments yesterday, however, she criticized his “tired & offensive cliches” in a tweet. Robert Reich, the secretary of labor under Bill Clinton, tweeted: “So 15 million American children in poverty just need better attitudes and they’ll have food in their stomachs and roofs over their heads?” Carson’s comments were not the only cause for concern for those working on poverty-related issues this week.\\nThe Trump administration’s 2018 budget calls for cuts of $6.2bn, or 13.2%, to HUD, alongside deep reductions in expenditures on Medicaid and food stamps. Although Congress will ultimately come up with its own spending plan, the president’s budget is taken as a reflection of his philosophy and priorities. Carson did not seem fazed by the possible slimming down of his agency. The budget proposal “reflects this administration’s commitment to fiscal responsibility while continuing HUD’s core support of our most vulnerable households”, he said in a statement, and states, local governments and the private sector were intended to pick up the slack. Carson was always an unlikely choice for his job. His experience in government is essentially limited to his 2016 presidential candidacy, and he is known for zany pronouncements – for instance, that the pyramids were grain storehouses rather than pharaonic tombs. This seemed of little concern to his supporters; during his confirmation hearing, Senator Mike Rounds said that “probably running this department is not really brain surgery.” Still, Carson’s hardscrabble upbringing – an adviser said his “mother worked three jobs at a time to keep them out of public housing” – and his medical background had suggested to some that he might bring empathy and a valuable perspective to the role. For one man currently experiencing poverty, Carson’s charge about his mental state rankles. “I challenge Ben Carson or anyone of his choosing with the ‘right mindset’ to step into my life on the streets,” said Brett Anderson, a homeless man who resides with his family in an RV in San Francisco. It would not be so easy, he said, to find a way out.   \n",

I have a mindfulness exercise for you, one guaranteed to bring calm. Instead of imagining a deep, cool lake or a beach of bone-white sand, comfort yourself by imagining the day, several years from now, when a Chilcot-style inquiry probes the epic policy disaster that was Brexit. As you take deep breaths, and with your eyes closed, picture the squirming testimony of an aged David Cameron under sustained interrogation. Look on as Boris Johnson is at last called to account for the serial fictions of the 2016 campaign. Or perhaps contemplate the moment the panel delivers its damning, final report, concluding that this was a collective, systemic failure of the entire British political class.\\nLast night’s series of votes in the Commons will provide a rich batch of evidence. Almost everyone involved, from both main parties, showed themselves to be immersed in delusion, trading fantasies and absurdities, each one refusing to meet reality’s eye, let alone tackle it head on. Most culpable, once again, is the prime minister. If our jaws weren’t already slackened to numbness by the last 30 months, they should have hit the floor at this latest performance. Theresa May had repeated endlessly, and for weeks, that her deal was the only deal on offer. Yet there she was, standing at the despatch box urging MPs to vote for an amendment that trashes that very same deal. The Brady amendment, which passed by 16 votes, demands what May had constantly said, up until yesterday morning, was impossible: the replacement of the Northern Irish backstop with “alternative arrangements”. It’s an extraordinary thing, this ability of May’s: she somehow manages to combine grinding intransigence with a willingness to perform the most brazen U-turns. Cheering her on was a Conservative party celebrating the rare thrill of unity. For the first time in ages, they could all be on the same side, declaring with one voice that what they really wanted was May’s deal minus the backstop. They beamed as if this result meant something, when it is in fact triply meaningless. First, it’s really no great achievement to get MPs to agree that they’d like the good bits of a deal but don’t want to swallow the bad bits: yes to the sugar, no to the pill. The Tories have united around a position that says they’d like the benefits of the withdrawal agreement, without paying all the costs. It’s the familiar Brexit delusion, which Brussels took all of six minutes to crush, by declaring – for the millionth time – that “the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation.” In other words, what the Daily Mail calls “Theresa’s triumph” is to have got her party to unite behind a stance that is doomed to fail.\\nBut even on its own terms, the vote is hollow. For what did MPs vote for but “alternative arrangements”? Not a specific, detailed counter to the backstop, spelling out concrete ways that a hard border might be avoided, but the nebulous promise of an “alternative”. When you don’t like x, then “not x” looks mighty alluring, not least because it can mean whatever you want it to mean. Brexiteers know the truth of that, because it was that same logic that saw them win the referendum itself. Their message back then boiled down to: do you want to stay in the European Union, with all its concrete, visible flaws, or would you like “alternative arrangements”? What we’ve all learned since is that the moment an “alternative” becomes real, it loses its all-things-to-all-people appeal. Which means that, even if Brussels were to relent and offer a revised proposal to the backstop, the new plan would enrage as many people as it would please – and would likely face rapid rejection by the Commons, by the Brexiteers swiftest of all. But the obloquy should not belong to the Tories alone. MPs had the chance to prevent the national cataclysm of a no-deal crash-out last night – and they refused to take it. They rejected Yvette Cooper’s amendment, which would have made such an exit impossible, thanks in part to 14 Labour rebels who concluded that even a slight delay to Brexit – just a few months – poses more of a threat to their constituents than a crash-out that could see shortages of food and medicine, with more warnings along those lines coming this morning from the leader of a major hospitals group. The future public inquiry into this horror show will damn those 14 especially. Instead, MPs voted for a toothless, non-binding amendment that confirms they don’t like no-deal very much, but are ready to do precisely nothing to prevent it. And while the Tories are still chasing unicorns, Labour is in its own fantasyland. Incredibly, shadow cabinet minister Richard Burgon was on TV last night still mouthing the same vacuities about “Labour’s alternative” Brexit and how it’s going to negotiate a “strong single-market relationship” – all the benefits, none of the costs – as if there isn’t only a matter of weeks to go till Britain leaves the EU. This just 24 hours after the party had embarrassed itself by planning to abstain on Tory legislation ending the free movement of people, only to reverse position 90 minutes later following a backlash on Twitter. The Sir John Chilcot of the future will note all this, even as she or he exempts the handful of MPs who are using every parliamentary wile they can to stop the country from slamming into the iceberg. The names Grieve, Cooper, Boles and others may earn themselves an admiring footnote in the report that will eventually come. But as for almost everyone else: they will be slammed for their role in a saga that disgraces this country and its supposed leaders more with each passing day. • Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist   \n",

is a guilty pleasure for many, but it doesn’t need to be this way. You can easily put a healthy spin on it by throwing in some veg – my favourites are kale and broccoli, which add a heap of vitamin K and a large pinch of vitamin C. If you’re pushed for time, this simple recipe works well as a delicious midweek dinner or side dish at a dinner party. Prep time: 20 minutes Cook time: 30 minutes Serves: 4 500g short macaroni 200g grated grana padano cheese 1 tsp freshly ground nutmeg 2 tsp sea salt ½ tsp coarse-ground black pepper 1 litre béchamel, either homemade or shop-bought 5 large kale leaves, washed and shredded 8 medium sized broccoli florets, blanched in boiling water for two minutes, then chilled under running cold water Heat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Cook the macaroni as per the packet’s instructions. Place all the ingredients in a large bowl, except for 50g of the grana padano. Gently mix until all the ingredients are distributed evenly, then use a spatula to empty the ingredients into a baking tray and level off. Finish by topping with the remaining grana padano. Bake in the oven for 30-35 minutes until golden brown and serve with seasonal greens.

after it prevented almost all of Thursday’s French national newspapers from being printed, as part of escalating nationwide strike action against the government’s changes to labour laws. The union’s strikers shut off printing presses and distribution and allowed only one newspaper, the leftwing daily L’Humanité, to be printed after it agreed to the union’s demands to publish an opinion piece by the CGT leader, Philippe Martinez. This sparked accusations from newspaper editors of a “shameful” attempt to pressure the media. It has emerged that CGT representatives contacted the French newspaper editors’ union on Wednesday, saying they insisted that every daily paper run a pre-written communique by Martinez, in which he called for the government proposalsto be abandoned.\\nL’Humanité, which was formerly the official publication of the French Communist party and which, although it has long been independent, retains strong ties to its political roots, was the only paper to publish the release. All other daily papers were prevented from publishing by the union, which shut off the printing presses on Wednesday night. “The CGT has decided to block the printing of newspapers who refused to publish, under constraint, a tract calling for the government to withdraw its labour laws,” said Nicolas Beytout owner of L’Opinion daily, in an online editorial. “This scandalous intrusion by the union into the content of the media must be denounced as a deplorable attack on democracy,” he added. Laurent Joffrin, the editor of the left-leaning daily Libération told France Inter radio: “We’ve never published a communique under pressure and we never will.” He denounced a “shameful and stupid” demand by the CGT.\\nDidier Lourdez, from CGT, told France Inter that the union had made “no demand, no diktat” but that the CGT had proposed that all papers give space to Martinez’s communique. “The freedom of the press and democracy have to work in both senses,” he said. “It’s us who are being held hostage by the government which wants to apply this law.” The newspaper editors’ union, the Syndicat de la Presse Quotidienne Nationale, said in a statement that newspapers were being held hostage by the union in a political dispute with the government that had nothing to do with newspapers. “Our readers are the victims,” the statement said. During the last two months of protests against the law, newspapers have been stopped from printing and distributing on two previous occasions in March and April. All French national papers were available free online on Thursday.   \n",

around that there’s going to be a shortage of champagne in the run-up to Christmas. It seems hard to credit given the squillions of bottles the Champenois produce every year, and it doesn’t exactly come into the same league of inconvenience as petrol shortages, but if you enjoy a glass of bubbly on New Year’s Eve and want to get it at a reasonable price, there’s no harm in picking some up now. According to Rob Cooke, chief commercial officer of Majestic, it’s not so much that there will be a shortage than that shoppers may not be able to find their favourite champagne at a discounted price. “The choice will be: do you stick with your normal brand if it’s not promoted, change brands or go for another sparkling wine?” Cooke’s hunch is that champagne still ticks the box for most when it comes to celebrations, so Majestic is focusing on lesser-known labels such as the smart, modern-looking 12% Labbé et Fils Brut Tradition, which sells for £27.99 as part of the store’s mix-six deal (which can be any wines, not just champagne). Unless, for you, the point of drinking champagne is that your guests should recognise what you’re pouring for them, this is a good strategy. Own-label champagnes such as the Tesco Finest Premier Cru below or Adnams’ very decent house champagne (£23.99, 12.5%) cost considerably less than big household names such as Moët or Veuve Clicquot. And if you appreciate champagne as a drink rather than a status symbol, you can get a top-quality growers’ champagne for the price of a basic grand marque. The other thing I’ve noticed is that champagne is getting even richer and toastier than it used to be, partly due to recent good vintages and partly to the higher proportion of dark-skinned grapes (pinot noir and pinot meunier) many houses are using. This is great if you’re planning to drink it with a meal (champagne is actually terrific with turkey), perhaps less good if you want it as an aperitif. “There’s an increasing polarisation between this and the very lean and mineral style,” says Cooke. “The middle ground is disappearing a bit stylistically.” If you like a lighter style, look for non-vintage rather than vintage champagnes, a lower “dosage” (the sugar solution that is added at bottling) or blanc de blancs – champagnes that are made purely from white-skinned grapes, generally chardonnay.

feeding the nation’s poorest children over the holidays. Social media, indeed all media that way inclined, had been full for many hours of people wondering how these MPs could possibly live with themselves. (The children’s minister! How can a children’s minister vote this way?) Certain Tory MPs – for brevity, the dumb ones – had taken to Twitter themselves to meansplain to the campaigning Marcus Rashford that the responsible stewardship of a nation involves keeping children hungry. Because numbers. And they say so. I tried to work out which Tory war game this related to. Are we talking your basic Sun Tzu: when your enemy is choleric, make him angrier by interning 1.3 million kids in a state of famishment? Is it more of a culture war: really whip up that base of people who hate virtue-signalling by selecting one fundamental human virtue, empathy, and kicking it to death? Which Facebook subculture is this meant to appeal to? Simultaneously, I was on the phone to my friend C, not 100% listening while she was saying something about spaghetti bolognese. “Do you think you can make bolognese at scale?” she asked. Sure. I once made a venison cobbler for 35. I can do anything. “OK, I’ve emailed the head. In every school there are those who can and those who can’t. He knows that.” Wait, what? “It probably wouldn’t take more than 10 of us.” It turns out that now the food-voucher plan has been voted down, she wants the school to stay open over half-term, and then we would cook, and whoever was hungry would just come in for lunch. Even the first bit is a completely mad idea. Never has a half-term been more devoutly wished for than this October’s, after six weeks of masks, bubbles, exhausted teachers, disoriented year sevens, panicking year 11 and 13s and everyone and everything in between. C and I have known each other since the kids were in reception, nine years ago. We used to talk a lot at the gates, but when they get to secondary school, there’s a determined teacher standing at the entrance saying “Bye Mum!”, so around that time we had to just admit we were friends, and socialise in the regular way. We don’t talk a lot about politics, and our politics aren’t the same, though we’ve had a number of discussions about Keir Starmer’s hair. I would say she’s a good barometer for me of what people think if they aren’t refreshing Twitter all day long, but that would be to overstate my engagement with the outside-Twitter world. Mainly, we talk about why Mr Z went to work without his wedding ring on (yes, really, this morning), and why Mr C needs four monitors in his home office (nobody knows), and the minutiae of being in the sandwich generation, caring for both kids and ageing parents, and how we wish we were the bread bit, not the middle bit. Listening to her mad spaghetti idea, what I realised – and I don’t think those Conservative MPs do (is it because so many of them privately educate their children, or their income depends upon their not realising it?) – is how viscerally everyone is affected by this. In a way, the less left-leaning and political they are, the more they abhor it, having none of the emotional insulation of thinking: “Same old Tories.” The poor are not a separate category that Channel 5 can make a discrediting documentary about. These are either your children or they’re your children’s friends. They live in your house, or they hang out in your house. You still have a pair of their pyjama bottoms from when they were in year four, or you’re missing a pair. You remember when their brother broke his arm. You remember the time they got a new coat that had stars on it, in 2015. It is impossible to exaggerate how connected parents are to each other’s children, even if actual conversations are so limited (“please”, “thank you” on their side, “don’t do that, you’ll break it” on yours) that it would be hard to discern from the outside. They don’t have to be at a cute age. You could no more live with the idea that a 14-year-old standing in front of you hasn’t had breakfast than you would walk past a two-year-old who was lost in a supermarket. This is where the self-styled neutral commentators hit the hard limit of their comprehension. They will show you polls that say 40% of the country agrees that children are hungry because their parents spend all their money on Netflix; they will point to callous comments under articles, and get in your grill with the hard reality of demographics, that the over-65s agree with Ben Bradley and there are more of them than there are of you. But what this analysis doesn’t get – and I don’t think Sun Tzu gets either, although needless to say I haven’t read him – is the asymmetry of feeling. Not caring is a relatively mild state, that you wouldn’t cross the street for. Caring is a hot and urgent state that preoccupies your mind. And a cottage bolognese industry is not the answer, but it’s closer to it. People are not walking on by, and they will not let this drop.   \n",

                                          Donald Trump skipped the G20 summit’s “Pandemic Preparedness” event to visit one of his golf clubs on the same day that a record 195,500 new Covid-19 infections were reported in a 24-hour period in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins. The summit, attended by world leaders from across the globe, is being held virtually this year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has now killed more than 250,000 Americans – by far the largest total in the world.\\nTrump’s apparent disinterest in the summit started earlier on Saturday when he started tweeting about the election results after the scheduled start time of the summit at 8am ET. The president appeared via video link during the summit’s opening remarks but by 10am, Trump was leaving the White House to go to his golf course outside of Washington DC, according to CNN. The event featured remarks from leaders, including the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, and was focused on the “coordinated response to the coronavirus pandemic and improved global pandemic preparedness”, according to its description. Before he left the White House to go to the golf course, Trump implied to leaders that he will be working with them in the future, a reference to the losing fight he has put up against the results of the presidential election. “I look forward to working with you again for a long time,” he told leaders, according to audio obtained by the Observer. Since Joe Biden was declared the winner of the election 7 November, leaders from around the world have congratulated Biden, including Macron; the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson; and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, acknowledging his victory even while Trump has refused to. According to a tally kept by CNN, Trump has visited one of his golf clubs on 303 occasions during his four years as president. During his 2016 campaign for the White House Trump regularly attacked his predecessor Barack Obama for hitting the links too often and insisted that he would have little time to play golf himself as president as he would be working too hard.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The vast array of superlatives attached to the Ryder Cup ignore the recent propensity for predictable outcomes. Since Europe trounced the United States in Michigan, 17 years ago, there has been just a single away victory. When that transpired, at Medinah, we all saw fit to brand it a “miracle”. The past three Ryder Cups have been won by the length of a par five.\\nFew events in sport do exaggeration better than the biennial joust of Florida-based millionaire Europeans and Florida-based millionaire Americans – and the Ryder Cup is all the better for such giddiness – but at some point the trend of home win after home win needs to be reversed. Foregone conclusions are no use to anybody with an interest in sporting merit. Padraig Harrington will subscribe to this theory, of course. Should Harrington lead Europe to glory at Whistling Straits in a month’s time, his career will have an outstanding team achievement alongside epic personal highs. The role of a Ryder Cup captain can sometimes be wildly overplayed but should Europe upset Bryson DeChambeau, Brooks Koepka, Dustin Johnson et al on their own patch, Harrington will be entitled to dine out on the triumph for years. Harrington may like to portray himself as an extrovert but he is also highly intelligent. His approach, including towards the opposition, will prove fascinating. Lost so far in the buildup to the 43rd staging of the Ryder Cup is the dynamic that will shift things heavily in favour of the United States. It lies in President Biden’s proclamation, barring entry to travellers from Europe. Such restrictions are often fluid but this one has held firm. It would be an extraordinary twist should golf fans from the UK, Ireland and Spain be allowed entry to the US in the final week of September. And with that White House-determined practicality, the Ryder Cup takes on fresh form. Home advantage will become an even stronger weapon in a competition that already looks formulaic on results alone. The PGA of America will not say what percentage of tickets have been sold to Europe-based fans. Those ticket holders are entitled to refunds, and they will surely be applied for due to the travel restrictions if they have not been already. The Ryder Cup’s official website states that “tickets sold directly through the PGA of America have sold out” and that “our plan is to host the 43rd Ryder Cup with full-spectator attendance”. That means tens of thousands in the galleries, each day. It seems logical to think 95% of them will be American, given that the away contingent is typically 10-15%. Even at that, their presence is felt.\\nIt must also be pointed out that some European fans live on the opposite side of the Atlantic. Shane Lowry rarely plays in a PGA Tour event without being roared on by someone in a GAA shirt. When an opportunity to watch a Ryder Cup so close to adopted homes in Chicago arose, many US-based European fans would have made plans. But the notion of a noisy delegation crossing the ocean in support of their brave boys, adding to the atmosphere in Wisconsin, is fanciful. There are senior UK golf executives who will not be able to attend. The European Tour’s own official party has been restricted because of travel rules. Those benefiting from vast marketing budgets may not want to admit it but this Ryder Cup cannot, by definition, be normal. Stars and stripes will dominate the scene. “Olé, olé, olé” will be reduced to a feeble murmur.\\nThere will be an early glimpse of what Harrington and his 12-man team can expect when Europe take on the United States in the Solheim Cup in early September. The LPGA last reported that event in Toledo is “all systems go” in respect of capacity crowds. Unlike the male equivalent, though, tickets do remain on sale for the match at the Inverness Club. Catriona Matthew’s European team are even bigger underdogs than Harrington’s. There remain matters worthy of more concern than whether or not Jon Rahm can be roared to glory against Tony Finau by men in Callaway caps and polyester polo shirts. Nonetheless, people see Ryder Cups as trips of a lifetime. More significantly, the event itself benefits from an element of rivalry in the galleries. In black and white, the United States and Europe playing each other at golf is not particularly a big deal. When tribal elements come into it and when players revel in the highly-charged atmosphere – for example, Rory McIlroy versus Patrick Reed in 2016 – its status is enhanced. “It’s just this amazing atmosphere with fans pulling for their team,” explained Jim Furyk. “You see players, like me, who are not usually emotional on the golf course, pumping their fists and screaming at the top of their lungs.” In 1927, boat decks were not crammed with Great Britain supporters before the inaugural Ryder Cup matches in Massachusetts. Now, however, this is an occasion of global standing. The recent British & Irish Lions series in South Africa is not a particularly valid comparison either as there were no fans present. In the Ryder Cup, odds already stacked in favour of the hosts will be shortened further by supporters screaming almost entirely in one direction. Without being anybody’s fault, this merely adds to Harrington’s challenge and, without question, diminishes the spectacle.   \n",

sapiens’ relationship with our long-lost relatives the Neanderthals has undergone a lot of rethinking since our relatively recent reintroduction in 1856. Until then, three years before Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species, we had no idea that they existed. Thanks to the Parisian anatomist Marcellin Boule, who “inaccurately reconstructed” a skeleton in 1909, the popular image of them has been of an ugly creature with a stooped spine and a “decidedly ape-like” appearance. Now, a blink of an eye later, we know that many of us – at least, those without sub-Saharan heritage – carry between 1.8 and 2.6% Neanderthal DNA. So it’s reassuring to read that these people whose genes we share were not the brutish caricatures of Victorian myth, but complex, clever and probably caring individuals with a lot to tell us about human life. Rebecca Wragg Sykes has studied their landscapes, territories and tools and emerges as an expert and enthusiastic character witness for Neanderthals and their way of life. In Kindred she looks at their “life, love, death and art”; and in the light of the fascinating evidence that is painstakingly presented here it seems likely that they had sophisticated tools, built home environments, art and ornamentation, family structures and possibly even “a richer culinary world than ours”. There is even evidence that they tidied up. Neanderthals probably didn’t have PR, but they do now.\\nNeanderthals became a distinct population 450,000 to 400,000 thousand years ago, and lived all over the world from north Wales to China and Arabia, in climates ranging from glacial to tropical, until about 40,000 years ago. They were shorter than we are, with strong arms for working hides and fine motor skills for making small tools, but probably saw, heard, smelled and possibly even spoke much like we do. With a sketch and a short piece of fiction at the start of each chapter, Wragg Sykes paints a vivid picture of life as lived by a Neanderthal parent, hunter or child. She doesn’t just want us to see Neanderthals for who they (probably) really were; she wants us to see their world through their eyes.\\nThe prose is a combination of the scholarly and the writerly, combining dizzying amounts of information about different types of stones, tools, bladelets and flakes with sentences such as “Squabbling crossbills and crested tits yielded to crass jays and mellifluous nightingales, until cold mornings saw clattering capercaillies sending breathy vapour into biting air.” The knowledge condensed here is certainly impressive. “The sheer amount of information is hard to process,” Wragg Sykes writes. “Few specialists have time to read every fresh article in their own sub-field, never mind the total scholarly output.” She describes, for example, how archaeologists refit tiny fragments of knapped artefacts back together like “an immense 4D jigsaw puzzle” to see how Neanderthals worked stone tools; what isotopes in dental calculus tell us about their diet and smoky fires; and how microanalysis of soil samples suggests careful placing – if not technically “burial” – of the dead. It’s clearly a subject that encourages and repays obsessive interest. Understanding Neanderthals’ place in history is important to show “how evolution didn’t follow an arrow-straight Hominin Highway leading to ourselves”, and to skewer white supremacist notions that sprang up around our early (mis)understanding of who different types of humans were. It is hard, though, not to draw some warnings for humanity from the fate of our near kin. Did Homo sapiens only thrive because of our larger and stronger social networks – “being welcome at the fires of friends many valleys away” when things got tough? Did Neanderthal populations collapse after one climate change event too many, and how might we survive our own? Or might they have been killed off by “a terrible contagion” that jumped between species? Sadly, we don’t know, though the next discovery may be the one to tell us. Until then, Wragg Sykes concludes, Neanderthals will continue to function as “the shadow in the mirror … a multispectral reflection of our hopes and fears, not only for their apparent fate, but our own”. • Kindred: Neanderthal Life, Love, Death and Art is published by Bloomsbury Sigma (RRP £20).
